** We Overcall or X/XX Summary

- Generally based more on shape than exact strength
- Usually 5 cards, 4 cards may have leading value occasionally, but normally we only bid if partner passed already, we
  are NV, and our hand is worth just one bid (perhaps with a longer minor)
- 1 level light major suit overcalls, ~(7)8+ hcp and sensible suits or unbalanced with low hcp or VUL
- 1D overcalls are likely 10+ reasonable opening bids (they are not very preemptive after all, even if lead-directing)
- 2 level minor overcalls are fine on "bad" 5 carders e.g. AJxxx+ iff partner not passed and have enough values / other suit tolerance
- 2 level minor overcalls should not be less than an opening hand, expect partner to look for 3N
- Responsive doubles to 3!s
- [2!c Advancer's Relay Strength Ask](#Advancer's 2C Relay) by advancer after 1!h/1!s overcall due to wide range
- [Einar cue bid](#Einar Cue Bid) by overcaller showing no good rebid or extras
- XX of major overcall is 10+ values with exactly doubleton support
- X by advancer is values ~(9)10+, maybe poor support
- Jump 2HS new suit is ~10â€“12 and good 6 card suit
- Jump 3x new suit is invitational and good 6 card suit
- Simple cue bids are varied in meaning, artificial - strength ask, HCR, even switch-transfer advancing a 2CD overcall
- Overcaller responding to transfers and transfer cues: complete with 2 / bad 3 cards, find another bid with less, with
  exciting hands bid more
- [HCR cue](#HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition) strength depends on other available bids
- 2N advance of 2x overcall is natural, otherwise [2N is support showing](#HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition)
- Switch transfers over 2CD overcalls
- Jump cue (3 level) is a mixed raise supporting a major
- Jump cue (3 level) is a splinter supporting a minor
- 3 level raise depends if responder bids or passes [pre-emptive and cooperative](#HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition)
- when opponents have 2 suits a 4th position (sandwich): cue sitting OVER is natural, cue sitting UNDER is *Michaels*,
  2N better Michaels (6--5 usually) unless there are three unbid suits then unusual
- when opponents bid (1 Major)--(1NT) cue is *Michaels*
- when opponents bid (1 minor)--(1NT), special case, 2C is (5--4) majors, 2D is 5--5 majors regardless of minor opened
- when opponents have 2 suits and partner doubles X: advancer's cue when sitting OVER is natural, advancer's cue sitting
  UNDER is a general force
- when balancing, e.g. (1!d)--P--(P)--2D, a cue bid is *Michaels*, never natural over prepared minor as sitting under
- when a passed hand reopens over 2!s, (1!s)--P--(2!s)--P--(P)--2N, this special case is 5--4+ minors (would double with !hs)
- over opponents bid (1!h)--P--(1!s), special case, 2H cue is !s + minor Michaels (not both minors), 2S is still natural cue sitting over
- over opponents bid (1!s)--P--(2!s), special case, 2N is 5+!hs with 4+ minor

*** Minimum/Equal Level Conversion and Takeout Doubles

OffShape Takeout / Conversion style is:

- bid naturally with 5--4 majors unless the 5 carder is terrible
- over takeout of a 2/3/4 level preempt we play equal level conversion (not minimum level), meaning bidding a new suit
  at a higher level is constructive/strong
- after 1 level takeout, conversion at the 1 or 2 level is considered equal / escaping and not showing extra values
- we can double with 4--4 majors over a 1 level minor bid, takeout responses are adjusted e.g. may bid 1H/1S with 3
  cards if lacking a 5 card minor
- !cs are usually bid naturally with a 4 card major as we often would be forced to the 3 level playing off shape
  conversion. However, over a 1D opening we do have space to convert back to !cs with only one 4 card major so could
  double

Takeout style:

- reasonable defensive values are required for a takeout double, not some very light overcall - advancer will push to
  game with 13+ and invite with ~10--12 on their own suit
- perfect takeout double shapes e.g. 4--4--4--1 maybe light "opening" values, i.e ~10 hcp
- 11 hcp doubles can be 4--4--3--2 without wasted values
- a jump in the lower suit or forcing to a higher level implies a two suiter 5--5+ (that doesn't fit into any two suiter overcall convention)
- concept may also apply to high level bids with limited space like 4N, e.g. (4!s)--4N, or a cue bid showing a two
  suiter when there are 3 unknown suits
- very strong single suiters are rare, and may need to jump cue bid or double and jump cue bid, or just bid game

*** Cue Bids and Jump Overcalls Summary

- natural single suiter overcalls are 2 level weak, 3 level weak NV, intermediate VUL
- Michael's and Unusual NT strength is wide ranging vulnerability dependent, NOT mini-maxi style

**** Two Suiter Overcall Strengths

- Less than *strong* (not mini-maxi style), with strong defined as 8+PT ~17+ hcp
- Majors have a dedicated jump cue for strong two suiters, others must start with a takeout double
- Spot cards make a difference
- 6--5 shape is great, ~3 hcp better than the equivalent 5--5
- Playing at the 3 level needs better suit quality, especially VUL
- The !h + minor 2!s cue and 2N force to the 3 level in both suits so need good quality
- The 2N extra quality accounts for us having the lowest ranked suits, so less likely to win the auction
- HCP outside your suits unless Ace or King have very little value - we want *offensive hands* that
can make a game opposite very little

Hand examples:

- Majors showing NV: most aggressive ~6+, min KJxxx (Q9|J10)xxx
- Majors showing VUL: ~9+, also a reasonable 2 level overcall, min K109xx AQxxx
- !s + minor showing NV: ~9+ values IN the two suits, min KJxxx Jx x AJxxx
- !s + minor showing VUL: ~10+ values IN the two suits, better spot cards or more hcp, min KQ10xx AJxxx
- !h + minor showing NV: ~10+ values IN the two suits, min QJ10xx AKxxx
- !h + minor showing VUL: bit better, 2H overcall is often safer, utter min x AQxxx Qx Kxxxx
- 2N unusual NV vs. VUL: extra aggressive where sacrifice suggestion sensible, e.g. 6--5 Kxxxx Qxxxxx
- 2N unusual NV vs. NV: ~10+ values IN the two suits, min QJ10xx AKxxx
- 2N unusual VUL: AJ109x KQxxx

**** After minor openings:

- cue of a short 2+ minor is natural
- cue of a natural or prepared 3+ minor is a non-strong majors hand
- over a prepared/short minor bid 1S with both majors (unless strong majors)
- jump cue is strong majors
- simple overcall with !s + other minor (or both majors against a prepared/short minor)
- weak (3 level VUL intermediate) jumps otherwise
- 2N is unusual

**** After major openings:

- 2N is unusual
- cue for major + other minor
- !s cue is more specific about suit strengths and matches with the 3!c special overcall -- (!h + !d limited) OR (!h + !c strong)
- (1S)--3!c is special, a rare 2 suiter showing bid instead of single suiter jump overcall
- weak (3 level VUL intermediate) jumps otherwise

** We Open they Interfere Summary

- 2 level simple bids are natural, F1 freebids, 8+ good suit or typical 9/10+, less than invite AFTER SUIT
- 1N/2x simple bids are transfers AFTER TAKEOUT
- 2 level new suit jumps are weak after suit or takeout
- a 1-under (3M--1) jump is mixed for a major
- other jumps are [priority fit or splinter](#Fit Jumps and Splinters in Competition)
- [Cue bids](#HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition) exactly invitational HCR OR minimum game hand / limited defensive values / marginal balanced game hands, AFTER MAJOR OPENING
- 1m--(2!c) then Stayman/NT system on AFTER MINOR OPENING
- 3 level jump raise is preemptive ~0--6 if a 1-under jump mixed raise is available, else mixed replacement AFTER SUIT or TAKEOUT
- [2N limit+ raise](#HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition), only stop if judge wasted values and minimum, implies likely to penalise opponents if we don't play the contract AFTER MAJOR OPENING, AFTER MAJOR TAKEOUT
- 2N is artificial various, except 1!d--(2!c), AFTER MINOR TAKEOUT or MINOR OVERCALL
- 1!c/1!d--(2 level jump) use the [Lebensohl scheme](#1NT Interference and Lebensohl)
- 1!c/1!d--(1N) use normal constructive [weak 1NT defence](#Opponents open 1NT) as we have no well defined suit
- 1!h/!s--(1N) 2!c is a good 8--10 raise, 2!d artificial 5--3 other major with 3 card support, 2M natural, 2N usual limit+ raise system
- Transfer bids after 1!c opening and 1HS O/C (not just over takeout X like 1!d!h!s openers)
- Negative doubles to 4!h
- XX after opponent's takeout double varies: values 10+ for a *major*, but next suit *transfer* after *minor* opening
- Support doubles by *opener* for partner's *1x major* response and *weak 2x major* response
- X/XX of cue bids of *our suit is extra length*, but of *partner's suit is Stolen bid* support showing

** 4th balancing of 1x openings

- same strengths
- 2N is natural stronger than X then NT bid, not unusual
- 2 minor cue is always Michaels as sitting under any prepared minor
- 2HS is a standard minimum opening good 6 carder
- slightly more chance of 4 card suit at the 1 level, e.g. AQJ10/Axxx/xxxx/x or avoiding 1N vulnerable
- 1N is ~11--14 (maybe 15 over 1!h/!s), use instead of a weak 4 card suit, no stopper guaranteed
- X usual takeout, but lighter ~8+ depending on shape
- jump cue bid is a stopper ask
- 4x jumps are natural

Follow up responses are roughly 1 point more conservative

**** responding to 4th balancing takeout X

(1D)--P--(P)--X
    2HS = ~11--13 major jump with a 4 card suit, 5 card majors a bit weaker
    2N = natural, ~11--14
    3CD = ~10--13 minor jumps 5 cards

**** responding to 4th balancing jump bid

- new suits are forcing natural
- cue strong (for passed hand) game try
- raise mixed weaker
- 2N forcing

*** Passed hand balancing

- Over (1!h) 1N is long minor + 4 !ss
- Over (1!s) 1N is long minor + !hs, more likely 5--5 as unlikely to out compete !ss
- 2N would be 6--5 lower unbid suits

** Law of Total Tricks Bidding

Normal advice about bidding to the level indicated by the law of total tricks applies.

However, re-evaluating hands in any competition or after just one bid from the opponents is important.

Adjust / downgrade:

- flat hands (especially 4--3--3--3!)
- slow values in opponent's suit
- slow values in short side suits (usually harder to setup)
- (partial) misfit indications
- wasted values sat over by opponents

Upgrade influences:

- distributional hands (though you may have added shortness support points already)
- extra trump length
- supporting slow values in your main suit(s), queens and jacks mean more there
- Aces and Kings, these are quick tricks/control cards
- double fit
- super fit, extra length


** We Open with Fit and Slam Potential then 4th Hand High Level Interference

- slam is potentially on
- we bid in 1st and 3rd then 4th hand interferes at a high level
- fit found

The primary situation is 1HS--2N, but there's other situations. In summary:

- 1HS--2N--(3x/4x) known major fit and game try plus
- 1HS--Splinter--(4x) major support splinter slam try
- 2D--4C--(4x) slam try suit set

Continuations in general:

- When 4th hand comes in high unsupported, then always *double* is *penalty*
- 3N by opener is always artificial when the opponents come in high after we have a fit
- See examples in [1HS--2NT Invite Plus Interference](#2NT Invite Plus Interference)

**** 3 level rebid available

1H--(P)--2N--(3D)
    X = penalty
    P = minimum, no control/shortness
    3H = suit rebid, minimum often 6 cards, !d shortness
    3S = extras, cue cooperative, GF, but not above game, unknown if !d control
    4C = extras, cue cooperative, GF, but not above game, unknown if !d control
    3N = extras, !d honour control, serious 3N
    4H = better hand, !d shortness

**** 3N bid available

1H--(P)--2N--(3S)
    X = penalty
    3N = extras, !s control, serious 3N, unknown if shortage or honour control
    4CD = extras, cue cooperative, GF, but not above game, unknown if !s control
    4H = minimum, !s control
    P = no !s control

**** No 3N bid available

Pass used to show a control in the overcalled suit.

1H--(P)--2N--(4D)
    X = good values, penalty
    P = no control/shortness
        X = extra strength ask (last train like), slam try
    4H = !d control implication, no control, assumes we will always compete to game


** HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition

Either when we open and 2nd position overcalls, or when we overcall and later advance the bidding, there is often a
choice between a HCR cue bid and a 2N support bid.

This mostly applies to 1HS openings or overcalls, but (1!c)--1D is also possible.

A 2N bid is natural in very few places - only when we overcall at the 2 level, 3rd hand passes and advancer bids 2N. As 3rd
hand has passed it can be reasonable to assume we can have the combined values for 3N.

The meanings applied when we open v.s. overcall are different:

*** When We Open

When we open 1HS a 2N bid after competition from 2nd hand is always support showing. What's the difference between
a HCR and 2N? Contrary to the common style of distinguishing 3 vs 4+ card raising we currently experiment with:

- HCR is invitational or minimum game hand, may stop at 3M. Maybe too defensive or weak to compete above 4M. Maybe
  interested in 3NT - defensive/balanced.
- The 2N bid is almost game forcing (only minimum opener with honours sat under overcaller may avoid game), opponent's cannot
  play undoubled

The differences depend on length in the opponent's suit, strength, offensive/defensive ratio

*** When We Overcall

The bids change in meaning compared to when we open and face an overcall. We may have a lot of tempo (e.g. responder
passes and partner overcalled 1!h!s giving us space and time), or we may be under pressure in a live auction (e.g. the
opponents have a fit and have raised or even preempt raised the auction - (1!d)--1S--(3!d)).

**** When Responder Passes

We have maximum tempo, so:

- jump raises are mildly cooperative, e.g. 4--7 and something suitable for level and vulnerability

**** When Responder Bids

- 3 level (jump or not) raises are cooperative, which allows partner to bid with the right hand (they do have a wide
  ranging overcall). Jumps are worth less than any invitational support bids we have, usually the sort of hand
  that expects to get pushed to the 3 level and so bids early to make the opponenents guess.
- double is variable in meaning, e.g. [responsive](#Responsive Doubles Style), values/cooperative over a 2 level third
  suit, or [Relay Lebensohl](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles) over jump raise. Doubling a raise from 3S becomes mainly value
  showing. If somehow the new third suit is bid at the 3 level, it should be penalty interest (less general values/cooperative).

**** Advancers Support Tools

Some may not be available depending on how high responder has pushed the bidding and so you have to blend the meanings

- jump cue bids are mixed raises
- cue bid of their raised suit or major is a HCR, worse than 2N
- cue bid of a 3rd suit is stop SHOWing, e.g. (1!d)--1S--(2!h)--3H. A cue over is *not* natural when partner has overcalled
  a suit.
- 2N is the best invitational raise, therefore usually unbalanced, but still possibly 3 card support and very good
  values (e.g. 13--15 hcp).
- cue higher than 3 of our suit should be splinter like, offensive GF


** Fit Jumps and Splinters in Competition

- Fit jumps only happen in competition
- Fit jumps take priority over splinters, making splinters in competition unavailable at times
- Fit jumps are impossible in the opponent's suit, always a splinter

When is a jump a fit jump?

*** Fit Jumps When We Simple Overcall

Always on, no complexity

- we simple overcall anything (1x, 1N, multi, weak two etc.), regardless of whether 3rd hands bids, regardless if advancer is 4th or 6th position

*** Fit Jumps When We Open

The following must *all* be *true* about the bid:

- below 4H game
- we have another way to bid the fit jump suit either naturally or artificially directly at a lower level
- we open 1HS or 2HS (and very rarely open 1!c!d, bid a suit naturally and then get delayed competition). Not over
  intermediate 2CD given limited space available to show NF or forcing natural suits. Not over 1CD as they do not show
  any suit.

*** What about a double jump?

Double jumps below 4H are fit jumps iff a fit jump is not available as a single jump, e.g. because a single jump shows a
natural invitational suit OR a 1-under mixed raise. Otherwise a double jump is a splinter below 4H game (a direct 4!h
could only be a splinter in a slow constructive auction - 2nd rebid e.g. 1!s--2!d--2!s--4!h).


** 2N Artificial Scrambling

There's a list of situations where 2N is used for [Lebensohl](#1NT Interference and Lebensohl). Other times it maybe
used for [raising our partner's suit in competition](#HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition) whether we open or
overcall. Additionally after opening 1C/1D/1H opener may use [Good-Bad 2N](#Opener's Good-Bad 2N Rebid in Competition)
to allow competing in new suits or good raising. Other times 2N maybe natural.

A scrambling 2N shows:

- no easy game possible, competing
- 2+ places to play, usually the minors as they are the suits usually forced to the 3 level
- not forced to bid by a double (it's Lebensohl if double forces partner to bid)

Overall it is rare as 2N is usually forced after a double (so a better minor Lebensohl 2N) or it is by a hand that can
reasonably have a natural 2N bid (when the opponents have opened first we often pass with 11--14 balanced)

(1D)--P--(1S)--X
(2S)
    2N = natural, could have good values
    3D = heart invite
    3H = competitive
    X = minors

Pass--(1H)--X--(2H)
  2N = scrambling (not RLEB), not forced, passed originally so limited strength

** Bidding to 4CD over 3HS competition is Invitational

E.g. (1S)--2D--(2S)--3D--(3S)

- 4D in this example is a game try
- Expecting to make 4 v.s. average hand, and game v.s. good hand

Designed for IMPs, only in matchpoints might it be worth to compete to 4!d - in IMPS 3!h!s is never a great final contract
as it risks going one off or worse making a game.

** 4N is it a Stronger Raise or Unusual in Competition

- Assuming we are forced by competition to go above 4N
- The default interpretation is an Unusual 4N, e.g:

1C--(4S)--P--(P)
    X = values
    4N = 5--5 two suiter

- With a known suit from partner it could be a strong raise or unusual when forced to 5 level:

1C--(1S)--X--(4S)
    X = values
    4N = 5--5 minors or !h slam try (partner has !hs)

- Where most suits have been bid then 4N shows stronger raise of partner's suit:

1H--(2H)--3D--(4S)
    4N = good !d raise

by Responder it follows the slam bidding 4N rules

1H--(2H)--3D--(4S)--P--(P)
    4N = !d RKB

- With long strong suit for partner it should clearly be RKB:

(1S)--4H--(4S)
    4N = RKB, !hs are a known long strong suit

(1D)--4H--(4S)
    4N = RKB, yes sometimes useful to show the minors but !hs should be a strong suit

- Voluntarily going beyond game is still RKB etc.

(2H)--X--(4H)--4S--(P)
    4N = RKB by agreement

(2H)--X--(3H)--4S--(P)
    4N = RKB, clearly RKB here as responsive X available instead of 4!s if 4 card support


** Unforced Rebids Show Extra Length, Not Values

E.g. (1C)--1!s--(P)--2!h--(X)

- overcaller can pass with nothing to say
- XX shows extra values, NOT LIGHT overcall, but not want to go higher if partner is minimum
- 2S extra length

** Opener's Second Round Double - After Partner's 2 Level WJS

Double shows support and extras in shape or HCP

1D--(P)--2H--(2S)
    X = extras, support
    3H = competitive

** Opener's Renegative Double for Both Majors

1D--(2C)--X--(3C)
    X = 4 cards both majors, extras

1C--(1D)--X--(2D)
    X = 4 cards both majors, good weak NT OR prelude to forcing with strong !c hand

** Opener's Good-Bad 2N Rebid in Competition

- After (2DHS) in 4th by the opposition (RHS of opener), 2N shows strong support or a weaker other suit.
- More common after strong 1C opening as a limited opener can often cue bid or jump to show a good raise

1H--(P)--1N--(2S)
    2N = good-bad, assumed weak !c or !d suit in this case as no suit to support
    3CD = maximum, natural
    3S = weird bid, GF, shortage

1H--(P)--1S--(2C) have room at 2 level here, so cue bid enough
    2DH = natural
    3C = max, good !s raise
    3S = medium, good !s raise

1H--(P)--1S--(2D) also just use a cue
    3D = max, good !s raise
    3S = medium, good !s raise

1D--(P)--1H--(2S) now benefit from artificial 2N
    2N = max, good !h raise, OR minors
    3CD = maximum, natural, 5--5 minors
    3S = GF, shortage

1D--(1S)--X--(2S) similar
    2N = max, good !h raise, OR minors
    3CD = maximum, natural, 5--5 minors
    3S = GF, shortage

1C--(P)--1H--(2S)
    2N = strong !h support without !s shortage, or more minimal 16--19 minor holding
    3H = invitational, probably weak NT
    3S = GF, shortage

1C--(P)--2D--(2H)
    X = penalty
    2S = strong, natural
    2N = minimum strong !cs
    3C = sound strong !cs
    3H = general force

[Example after 1D opening](#Good-Bad 2N over 2DHS interference by 4th hand)

** Opener's Good-Bad 2N Rebid After Major NF

- 4th hand may or may not bid, e.g. 1D--(1S)--2H--(2S).

Main examples:

- 1C--(X)--2HS weak 5--7
- 1C--(1D)--2HS weak 5--7
- 1DHS--(overcall/X)--then weak jump shift
- 2C--(any)--2HS NF
- 2D--(any)--2HS NF

2N = strong support or weaker other suit
3CD = stronger natural bid
3M = competitive


** Einar Cue Bid

- catchall cue bid lacking a suitably natural rebid -- minimum with 5 carder or maximum hands
- overcaller cue bids opener's suit at the TWO level after advancer bids (or shows somehow) a new suit e.g.
(1D)--1S--2C--2D or (1C)--1H--1S--2C.
- never too high to stop advancer rebidding their major suit at two level or minor at 3 level
- continuations natural, e.g. simple rebid by advancer 8--11, 2N ~12--14, 3M invite, new suit F1

I.e:

- (1CD)--1H--1S: 2CD cue
- (1C)--1!d--1H/1S: 2C cue
- (1H)--2!c--2!d: 2H cue
- (1S)--2!c--2!h: 2!s cue

Typically shows:

- a) minimum ~8--11(12) without natural rebid (often 5--3--3--2) OR
- b) inbetween major support, e.g. ~12 hcp with 3 card support, too good for 2M raise
- c) 13+ hcp, good hands hard to describe so generally forcing showing extra strength
- NOT a 6 card minimum two level suit rebid
- NOT a 3 level jump which shows extra values AND distributional

** Advancer's 2C Relay

- we overcall 1M and responder passes
- shows either 9+ hcp, usually Hx+ to bad 3 card, often flattish, OR 13+ hcp catchall (semi)balanced with no support
- strength asking relay to handle the wide ~8--16 hcp overcalls.
- mostly natural (make it up) except for 2!d to show 12+
- As a 2N rebid bypasses 2M and is not artificial 12+, it conventionally shows a shapely ~10--11 6 carder, e.g. 6--4

Examples:

(1CD)--1H--2C
    2D = artificial, 12+ hcp
        2H = NF, ~9--11 Hx or real support
        2S = F1, natural (unusual given 1!s response opportunity)
        2N = GF waiting, ~12+ hcp
        cue = F1, semi-natural or just forcing
        3om = GF, 5+ minor, Hx major support, e.g. Axx Kx xxx KQ10xx
        3H = invitational, support
        3N = ~13--15 balanced
        4x = 3 card support splinter
    2H = 8--11, main suit nothing special
        2N = natural, invitational
        cue = F1, with Hx major support
    2N = F1, 10+ shapely, e.g. 6 card main suit and 4 card side suit, forcing to 3H
    3x = 8--11, 5--5
    3H = 8--11, excellent 6+ cards main suit (not mandatory with minimum)

(1CD)--1S--2C
    2D = artificial, 12+ hcp
        2H = forcing, 4 card !h suit (use transfer with 5 cards), e.g. xx KJxx AJx Axxx
        2S = NF, ~9--11 Hx or real support
        2N = GF waiting, ~12+ hcp
        cue = F1, semi-natural or just forcing
        3om = GF, 5+ minor, Hx major support, e.g. Kx Axx xxx KQ10xx
        3S = invitational, support
        3N = ~13--15 balanced
        4x = 3 card support splinter
    2H = 8--11, natural side suit
    2S = 8--11, main suit nothing special
        2N = natural, invitational
        cue = F1, with Hx major support
    2N = F1, 10+ shapely, e.g. 6 card main suit and 4 card side suit, forcing to 3S
    3x = 8--11, 5--5
    3S = 8--11, excellent 6+ cards main suit (not mandatory with minimum)

*** Advancers 2C Relay Interference

- pass with nothing to say
- over double or 2D *system on*, e.g. bid or double 2D with artificial, 12+ hcp


* Doubles

- Is it a standard *negative* double situation? Negative X played to 4!h (but more values showing Thrump style over
  double jump to 3!d!h!s). Promising the unbid major(s) or ability to handle the auction based on partner's next bid. Used
  to start a *stop ask* (Directional Asking Bid).
- Is it a standard maximal *competitive* double situation? Competitive X played to 3!s. Double of opponents' raised
  suit, both sides have a fit and game is possible, e.g 1H--(2D)--2H--(3D)--X
- Is it a standard [*responsive* double](#Responsive Doubles Style) situation showing the other two suits? Responsive X
  played to 3!s. Partner does takeout X or overcalls of opener and then we X the opponents' raise (OBAR). Their raise
  can be artificial.
- Over Live auction 4x raises from the opponents doubles are more "values" based (awkward cooperative not highly
  distributional). Note some play "responsive" to 4H or higher. At the 4 level there's not much meaningful difference
  between general values and responsive.
- Freely bid new suits (not live supported) at the 4 level by the opponents typically has a penalty emphasis unless it's
  the initial overcall in which case it's negative up to 4H. Doubles of 4th hand up to 4H are max support after 1DHS
  opening.
- Special annoyance 1C--(4x) is treated like 1N--(4x) values/negative-ish
- Special annoyance 1C then 4th bids 4x such as 1C--(P)--1N--(4D) are "penalty", assuming opener has a NT hand and
  punishing. Penalty maybe made with a less distributional strong hand. As with any 4x preempt partner may still
  "cooperatively" bid something else with a very distributional hand

Live auction 4x pressure examples:

- 1C--(P)--1D--4x 1C bidder treats as 4x opener
- 1C--(2H)--3x--(4H) then double from 1C bidder is general values without good support for any shown suit
- 1D--(1H)--X--(4H) as we play support doubles to 4H this should be good values for 1D plus 3 card support
- 1S--(2C)--2S--(4C) max values cooperative
- 1S--(2D)--3D--(4D) as partner is basically inviting, this is good values with a defensive hand
- 1S--(2H)--2N--(4H) given the good raise the values maybe more defensive than extra HCP, more penalty focus (nominally 2N system inteference on but that assumes 4th coming in alone)
- 1S--(2H)--3S--(4H) over partner's mixed raise like hand, double still is extra values defensive preference
- 2D--(2S)--3D--(4S) extra values defensive, partner may have a bad hand
- 2D--(2S)--3C--(4S) general defensive values, not necessarily extras as 3C was forcing
- (2x)--X--(4x) auctions are values
- (1x/2x)--P--(3x/4x) treat as opening 3x/4x preempt


** Blanket Rules

Where the above do not apply.

Blanket rules apply up to 2!s - if not sure above 2!s assume penalty (others play this to 3!s).
*"All doubles of bids through 2!s are takeout UNLESS"*:

1. It's defined above as one of *Negative, Competitive or Responsive*
2. partner responded 1N/2C/2D, doubler sitting over. Compare when open or overcall -- [Overcalls of our NT](#Overcalls of our NT) first double is takeout, second penalty.
3. our side bid and raised a suit. So, 1H--(P)--2H--(2S)--X should be penalty, whereas 1H--(1S)--2H--(2S)--X is competitive.
4. our side redoubled
5. our side made a penalty double or penalty pass
6. the bid doubled was artificial
7. partner preempts
8. our side are in a GF (1!h/!s + 2/1, 1!c--1N/2!s)
9. our side invites 3N (1!c--2!s, 1!c--2N)
10. our side limits hand with no major (1!c--1N/2!c is no major OR maybe major but already in a GF)
11. a passed hand doubles their solo rebid, (1H)--P--(P)--X--(2H)--X
12. our side does a takeout double then doubles a 2 level+ different suit or 2NT+ (so not a responsive double)

** Takeout Doubles

Modern standard:

- happy to X with minimum when have the other major
- happy to have a doubleton in an unbid minor if we have the major(s)
- 1C/1D takeout emphasises the majors, nothing about the minors (see Minimum Level Conversion Doubles)

Consider a takeout X (and maybe later DAB cue bid) instead of a 1NT bid with 4--4--3--2, the other major and the sort of hand where
partner should play NT (we have Axx they Qx)


** Relay Lebensohl Doubles

- After we open or overcall, there are many times the opponents raise the bidding to the 3 level *before partner responds* (maybe be a good passed hand)
- Played when we have shown a suit, so opened 1HS, overcalled or takeout double
- Double is a relay to the next suit, instead of being a "responsive" double or negative double, with competitive hands
- Double of most 3 level bids, anything that's not specifically shortage showing, so fit jumps, new suits,
  natural raises or artificial raises. Doubling a shortage implies our own double fit or a very good suit with sacrifice interest
- A later cue bid or 3N by doubler shows a normal negative double
- Lebensohl like allowing a distinction between competitive bids and genuine GF new suits / support invitational raises

Note, over 3S double can be competitive relay like, but we initially assume it's asking for a stop (Thrump).

It's conceivable to play this after we open 1C/1D/1N, but without a known long suit finding a stop or checking for a
4 card major should be more frequent and useful than just having the option to compete, certainly for IMPs.

Examples:

- 1HS--(3x)
- (1H)--1S--(3H)
- (1H)--1S--(3C) support showing bid
- (1H)--1S--(3C) anything, not shortage showing
- (1H)--X--(3H)
- (1H)--X--(3C) support showing bid
- (1H)--X--(3C) anything, not shortage showing
- (1H)--2D--(3H)
- (1H)--2S--(3H) our weak jump overcall
- (2D)--X--(3D)
- (2H)--X--(3H) weak two preempted further
- (2H)--2S--(3H)
- (2D)--2S--(3H) multi preempted further

When we open and the opponent jump bids, it's often a preempt (maybe intermediate). Here, it's good to have a way
to find a slam and not preempt a preempt. E.g.

1H--(3D)
    3H = natural limit raise
    4H = slam try without !d control, not obstructive

When they open a slam is very unlikely for our side and a penalty double will rarely be useful. E.g.

(1H)--1S--(3H)
    3S = natural limit raise
    4S = obstructive, ambiguous strength

*** Optional Extension After 1C Opening or 1D Opening and Raises

Given that a 1C and 1D opening can be ambiguous, the relay double can be extended to auctions such as:

- 1C--(1H)--X--(3H) or any other 3 raise
- 1C--(2H)--X--(3H)
- 1C--(1S)--X--(3S)  (mixed thrump / competitive double over 3!s)
- 1D--(1H)--1S--(3H)
- 1D--(2H)--X--(3H)

Responder has shown a suit and the opponents have raised it to the 3 level. Given that 1C (and less so 1D) are quite
vague we can treat opener as having not bid.


** Responsive Doubles Style

A standard responsive double is a form of takeout with focus on the unbid major(s). When partner makes a takeout double
advancer's double is a form of re-takeout. Sometimes it is more values, perhaps with a single minor suit, tolerance for partner but
lacking a stop for NT.

What about when there is no unbid/implied major? For example, (1H)--1S--(2H) or (1S)--X--(2S). Should our responsive
double be used to cater for minor hands with values?

- (1H)--1S--(2H), we know overcaller has 5 cards and use the usual HCR, or 2N support bids, 2S limited support or
  3S cooperative -- lots of options, therefore double can be a standard takeout bid showing the minors and relevant
  values for the level
- (1S)--2H--(2S), we also know overcaller has 5 cards, 2N is a support bid. The HCR goes beyond 3 of our suit and
  therefore is GF and shortage/offensive showing. 3H, however, can still be used as competitive, therefore double is
  the typical responsive values with the minor(s)

Pushed to the 3 level, things are different. Here we choose to play [Relay Lebensohl Doubles](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles)
to allow competing in partner's suit or a different suit.

- (1H)--1S--(3H), with limited bidding space, a standard 3S becomes cooperative to game and double a typical takeout,
  but played with [Relay Lebensohl Doubles](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles) 3S is invitational. A hand without a stop and
  limited !s may struggle with this style.
- (1S)--2H--(3S), in standard style as forced to the 4 level this is a mainly values showing responsive double, but
  we interpret it as Thrump OR [Relay Lebensohl Doubles](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles)

The double is always more value showing as it gets high level, especially over 3!s. At the 4 level we just call our
double "values" showing instead of responsive.

What about when the opponents raise a minor?

- (1D)--1S--(2D), there's a lot of space and various support showing bids so double is similar to a negative double
  showing 4 !hs (maybe 5 bad ones). With a good 5!h hand we could just bid 2H, or 3H with a 6 card good invitational
  hand.
- (1D)--1S--(3D), again [Relay Lebensohl Doubles](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles) + invitational 3S bid. The alternative
  standard style could use 3S as cooperative mildly invitational bid.

When we bid a minor?

- (1S)--2C--(2S), the 2C overcall virtually denies !hs, so double can show 5 !hs or 6 bad ones. Standard responsive
  doubles focus on the two other suits, e.g. 4!hs and 5!ds, which makes it less clear that bidding the other
  major directly promises 6 reasonable cards. There is no room for a jump invitational 3H bid so the distinction is
  important.

When we start with a takeout double:

- (1D)--X--(2D), we cannot expect partner to have 5 cards in a particular major, rarely not even 4 cards. We cue bid 3D
  with GF both majors 4--4+ (or possibly one major and slam try with shortage) or double with values and one 4 card
  major (or less than an invite both majors), so 2N [RLEB](#Reversed Lebensohl RLEB) with both majors + stop and an
  exact invite is possible, though maybe clearer to punt the 3D GF cue
- (1D)--X--(3D), similar but more pressure. [Relay Lebensohl Doubles](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles) + 3HS invitational.
  Subject to further refinement, given that doubler may not have both majors. Perhaps double 3+ both majors + 3HS with 5
  cards invitational is better.

Takeout over a major:

- (1M)--X--(2M), no promise of a 5 card other major by doubler. [RLEB](#Reversed Lebensohl RLEB) is on here. Double can
  show values with 4 card major support instead of maybe values and minors (similar to doubles after interference over
  1NT). Bidding the other major directly or via Lebensohl at the 3 level should indicate 5 cards
- (1H)--X--(3H), [Relay Lebensohl Doubles](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles) + 3S invitational. Given that a takeout double is
  not as wide ranging as an overcall the standard alternative with double as "values", a competitive 3S and
  no invitational bid is reasonable
- (1S)--X--(3S), double is Thrump OR [Relay Lebensohl Doubles](#Relay Lebensohl Doubles). Unsure of !h length, the
  alternative standard double showing values (with 5!hs would probably just bid 4H) is reasonable.


** Activity Doubles and Splinters

When the opponents show a short suit that does not make much sense for us to lead, such as a splinter, then
despite us apparently lacking strength, double should be for activity, in this case a potential sacrifice

Note, an alternative is takeout, e.g. !ss if they bid !hs and more general takeout if they have the master !ss

** Activity Doubles by Weak Often Preempt Hands

A weak hand that has already described some offensive ability, such as a weak two, cannot reasonably have a penalty double
of any game the opponents bid, UNLESS partner has had space to show GF values and defense.

So, if we open with a preempt, it is possible for the preempter to double with extreme shape (e.g. 6--4/6--5 after 2HS openings)
and shortage in the opponents' suit, which suggests sacrifice unless partner can pass with a penalty trump stack.


** Single Raise they Compete We Double

- Double shows extra values (possibly penalty)

1H--(1S)--2H--(2S)
    Dbl = extra values, lacking extra length
    2N = general game try, not exposing opener
    3CD = natural trial bid, exposing opener
    3H = weaker not invitational, reasonable suit/shape
    3S = GF, !s shortage, offensive hand

1HS--(P)--2HS--(2/3x)
    Dbl = penalty (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)

1HS--(P)--2HS--(X)
    XX = extra values and not just length as partner supported, forcing to 3HS or penalties
    3HS = NF

1HS--(X)--2HS--(3oM)
    Dbl = extras, penalty suggestion (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)
    3HS = NF

1HS--(any)--2HS--(3raise)
    Dbl = extras, penalty suggestion (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)
    3HS = NF

** 2N support raise then we Double

- More likely have game on, so double is NOT penalty interest if they bid raise a suit
- Where they have no fit double remains penalty

1HS--(any)--2N--(any)
    Dbl = penalty, (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)

1HS--(2x)--(2N)--(3x)
    Dbl = extra values, shortage - SPECIAL non-penalty agreement
    4x = (below game), void


** Delayed Takeout Doubles

When not doubling on the first round:

- X is typically long in the opponents' first bid suit
    - short in opener's second bid suit
    - short in responders bid suit when opener rebids the same suit
- decent strength, often 4 card suits competing

** Stolen Double by advancer - Opponents' HCR double

(1H)--1S--(2S/3S)
    X = "Stolen" bid, double I would have bid that.

** Anti-Leading Doubles of Raised or Strongly Bid Suits

- strongly bid means shown 6 cards already
- typically a 3 level anti lead double

The extra length meaning has less value when we have already shown a 6 card suit or our side has raised the suit.


** Extra Length 2 Level Double of Cuebid by Opener - Partner not bid

1H--(1S)--P--(2H)
    X = extra !h length, extra values inviting 3!h bid with Hx+ support
    3H = very good suit and shape, extras

Other examples:

- 1D--(1HS)--P--(2D)--X
- 1S--(2CDH)--P--(2S)--X

Pass then later X would allow opener to compete in the minors suits.

** Double Showing HCR by advancer - Opponents' 3x raise

- (1x) then overcall by us then the opponents raise to (3x)
- Note, (1x)--1M--(2x) then X is values 9+ as we have space for 2N invite plus raise

X then shows a HCR.

** Extra trump redouble - we stop 2HS they takeout X

Examples:

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener shows 4 card support as may have raised with only 3 cards

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

1M--(P)--1N--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = responder has 3+ card support opposite 6 cards

1M--(P)--1N--(P)--2CD--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = opener has 6 cards

1M--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = pointless?, 6 cards, dead minimum presumably as facing a 3 card invite

1N--(P)--2D--(P)--2H--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener has 3 card support

1C--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = 5 card weak NT hand

1C--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

1C--(P)--1H--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = opener has 5 cards

** FSF Redouble or Other Artificial Forcing Bids

When opponents double an artificial bid for lead direction

- XX for strong play suggestion (e.g. 4 very good / 5+ reasonable suit)
- Pass to play if partner can help in support e.g. Hxx+
- Cannot play in the contract only doubled, must be redoubled
- Otherwise bid on as if not doubled

** Handling doubles of our stopper ask of their suit

Helping to right side 3N or not play it.

(1S)--X--(P)--3C--(P)--3S--(X) = lead-directing X of DAB
    P = xx, Jx, or xxx in their suit
    3N = good stopper, e.g. AJx
    XX = either a full or partial stopper (Qx, Jxx)
    bid = singleton only in their suit
    4S = void in their suit

3!s cue here could be a proxy for a very strong unbalanced hand, not a DAB with something in !s, but then 3N will be pulled anyway.

** Confidently Bid Game/Slam Contract Lead Directing Doubles

If the opponents bid confidently suit doubles are *Lightner* and NT doubles have standard meanings (lead our suit/suits,
else dummy's first bid suit or the shortest major). See [Special Leads](#Special Leads).

*** 5 Level Doubles in Competition

- Generalization: if in doubt, the 5 level belongs to the opponents
- Caveat: phantom saves with highly distributional competitive hands at IMPs are often a reasonable insurance policy

Phantom saves at matchpoints are far more tolerable than at IMPs, indeed there are many attempts to go minus 100 insted
of minus 110 etc at matchpoints etc. The double game swing (along with slams) is one of the greatest sources of IMP
gains/losses, so on highly distributional hands it can pay to ignore the usual caution around phantom saves at IMPs,
and bid to go an expected one off in a 5 level contract

**** We "Own" The Hand

Typically we were expecting to bid and make some 4 level game, or maybe 5CD and then they interfered.
In these 5 level situations there is a first and second bidder on our side. For the first bidder:

- Double is minimum / defensive
- Pass is *Forcing*, interest in bidding more
- Bidding shows uncommunicated extras

For the second bidder:

- Pass (requires partner to have doubled) and agrees to defend
- Bidding shows near slam values or extra distribution
- Double to defend, not accepting an invitation to play at the 5 level

**** We Do NOT Own The Hand

Generally pass or sacrifice further!

A double is *Lightner* by default, assuming you think they bid confidently


* Opponents open Strong 1C

Show majors, especially !s and bid to limit. Pass then later bid unusual NT if really want
to show !c+!d.

With limited strength may want to hide distribution information and just bid the major (not 1N / 2N overcalls).

* Opponents open 1NT

Competing over 1NT.

- Aggression is vulnerability and scoring dependent, e.g. NV matchpoints with 11+ then 4--4 majors may compete

Hand strength guide:

- Against a weak NT, we must be mostly constructive ~11--14, and even more so v.s. a weak NT at IMPs (unless already passed)
- Against a weak NT, there is risk in bidding but also risk in passing, so 13--14 hcp often need to do something
- 5 card single suiter bids should have some extras in shape/strength, e.g. 5--4--3--1 shape and 11--14(15) hcp
- 6 card single suiters can be a bit lighter but basically an opening bid
- The balancing position can be lighter, i.e. 10+ hcp for a normal hand against a weak NT and ~14+ for a "penalty"
  double (at which point partner will probably run with less than 8 hcp)
- Max 7 losers, again, basically an opening hand
- Consider wasted honours and intermediate spot cards if it's a borderline maybe biddable hand, e.g. AK10xxx K10x xx xx
- The rule of 8 ( length(longest 2 suits) - LTC >= 2 then bid ) is too aggressive outside strong NT (mostly matchpoints) defence
- 5--5 two suiters may stretch to ~ 9 hcp
- Generally not balanced, including 5--3--3--2, until you have values for penalty double.
- Balancing 4--4 majors takeout maybe acceptable NV vs NV at matchpoints

An alternative would be 3C both majors and 3D multi-like some weaker major overcall. Less majors definition with 3C but
advancer can ask for the longest with 3D.

* Opponents open 2N Natural

X is majors takeout, NT is minors.

* Opponents open 3CDHS

- Normal takeout doubles, conservative opening bid values 12+, assumes ~7â€“9 hcp from partner

(3x)--X--(4x)
    X = takeout with decent values, inviting penalty pass

* Opponents open 3N

Whether a gambling solid/broken minor with/without side honour or a similar solid major.

Limited space, so double is rather catchall with 4CD bids special major bids:

- one bid for majors 5--4+ (with room to separate the longer suit)
- one bid for stronger major 2 suiter
- 3N double includes !d overcalls
- 4th double takeout

(3N)
    Dbl = Various
        - strong balanced (first assumed type)
        - strong 3 suited (will re-open X after escape)
        - one suited with !d
        - maybe weaker than a direct overcall of 4HS

    Cue = 2 suited, unspecified over 4!c and both majors over 4!d

* Opponents open 4CD SAT/Namyats

Showing good !h/!s major preempt, maybe minimum opening values.

- cue with 2 suiter
- 2nd double takeout, not showing that suit
- pass then bid with weaker distributional OR balanced hand (double)

(4C)
