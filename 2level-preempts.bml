#+TITLE: 2H and 2S preempts and Defences

* 2HS Weak Openings

*** 1st/2nd style

The style is to use a slightly narrower (more constructive) but frequent hand strength range without the drop in
frequency of 2/3 top honour requirements.

- ~7--10, 6 card suit
- 6 cards when vulnerable, but can [optionally play mixed 5 or 6 cards NV](#NV 1st/2nd 5 or 6 card Extension)
- relatively constructive, no more than one Ace weaker than opening hand
- Good 10 hcp hands consider opening 1HS where good, e.g. beware 2 aces, ~Kxx+ in the side major or a singleton
- Ace in a preempt suit may have more value in defense if partner is short due to ruffs
- suit quality 1 top honour: Axxxxx+, Kxxxxx+, Q10xxxx+
- even with sensible shape and 1 trump honour, consider if too defensive
- extreme shape 6--4/6--5 with long 4/5 card minor possible, max 9 hcp
- beware downgrade wasted values e.g. Qx/KQxxxx/xxx/xx

*** 3rd/4th style

- ~5--11, *Undisciplined in 3rd*, 5--4, 5--5, 6 card poor quality, possibly 4 card other major
- ~10--13 in 4th

*** Responding

- 3 level forcing bid must be made to play game in the other major as jump new suits are control asking bids

**** NV 1st/2nd 5 or 6 card Extension

Adjustments to playing mixed 5/6 card major weak two bids in 1st/2nd position non-vulnerable only.

Still ~7--10, rarely 6 hcp if 5--5 shape. Differences to the standard 6 card only definition:

- 5 card good suit possible and the usual 6 card suit
- 5 carder should have 2 honours (top honours unless excellent spot cards)
- 5 carder still unbalanced 5--4+
- 5--4--2--2 hands downgrade unsupported side Q/J honours, a side A or K is more useful
- 5 carder requires a shortage or a maximum 9--10 hcp

Responding:

- except for the 2N ask bid, same responses, so no !c signoff and no !c suit slam investigation beyond control asking bids then a punt
- after 2N the 4CD !h/!s slam tries allow slam bidding in either major after assessing the 5 vs 6 card major situation
- except other major sign off is to play, the opening major is implicitly agreed unless slam try in other major
