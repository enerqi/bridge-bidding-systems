#+TITLE: Youth Bridge System

* Overview

A bidding system reference guide that covers the English U16 squad agreements. The guide is mostly bidding trees, often
too brief to be detailed teaching/learning material by itself.

- A natural 5--5--4--2 bidding system (5+ card major 1 level openings, natural 1!d, short 1!c)
- Strong NT 15--17
- Three suit weak two bids


Bids in brackets e.g (1!h), (bid), (any), (1N) etc. indicate the opponents made the bid.

- Dbl or X = double, XX = redouble
- GF, FG = game forcing
- NF = non-forcing
- M = major, oM = other major
- m = minor, om = other minor
- Bal, flat = balanced
- x = e.g. 3x, some 3 level bid

A few are marked "(advanced)" - more experienced practiced partnerships may find these useful. Such partnerships may
want to look at these [Adventurous Improvements to your System](youth-improvements.html) for extra ideas.

* Opening Bids Summary

- rule of 20 one level openings, meaning very good 11 balanced or 12+ balanced, 11+ hcp with 5--4, 10+ hcp with 5--5 etc.
- max hcp values for an unbalanced 1 level opening is 21, rarely 22 hcp e.g. 5--4--2--2 wasted values in short suits etc.
- 3rd hand maybe light and preempts more aggressive


1C = [~10--21, 2+ !cs](#1C Opening)
1D = [~10--21, 4+ !ds](#1D Opening)
1H = [~10--21, 5+ !hs](#1H Opening)
1S = [~10--21, 5+ !ss](#1S Opening)
1N = [15--17 balanced, maybe a 5 card major](#1NT Opening)
2C = [artificial strong, 23--24 balanced or any game forcing hand](#2C Opening)
2D = [weak, 5--9 (10--13 4th position), 6!ds usually with 2+ honours, maybe 5!ds 1st NV or 3rd](#2D Opening)
2H = [weak, 5--9 (10--13 4th position), 6!hs usually with 2+ honours, maybe 5!hs 1st NV or 3rd](#2H Opening)
2S = [weak, 5--9 (10--13 4th position), 6!ss usually with 2+ honours, maybe 5!ss 1st NV or 3rd](#2S Opening)
2N = [20--22 balanced, maybe a 5 card major](#2N Opening)
3CDHS = [weak, ~4--9 hcp, 7+ cards usually with 2+ honours, maybe shapely 6 cards 1st NV or 3rd](#3CDHS Opening)
3N = [gambling solid minor](#3N Opening)
4CDHS = [preempt, ~4--9, 8 cards usually with 2+ honours, maybe excellent 7 carder](#4CDHS Opening)
5CD = preempt, offensive hand, usually 8--9 expected tricks with a long 8 card minor (9 cards is extremely rare)

- 1!c with *any* balanced 4 card major hand without 4!ds (4--3--3--3, 4--4--3--2 or 4--4--2--3 hand)
- 1!d with 4--4 minors, balanced or unbalanced (e.g. 1--4--4--4)
- highest of two 5 card suits

General responding:

- 1 level new suit is 5+ hcp forcing
- 2 level new suit is game forcing. Occasionally 2CD is 3 cards balanced with a hand too strong to go straight to game
- 1S--2H promises 5 !hs
- usually show two 4 card suits by bidding up the line (lowest rank first), except...
- ...show a major first hiding a longer minor if less than a game invitational hand
- ...bid 2CD game forcing balanced with a 4 major + 4 minor (sometimes 3 card minor to setup a force)
- show two 5 card suits by bidding the highest ranked suit first

* 1C Opening

Includes any balanced hand without a 5 card major and without 4!ds (except 15--17 NT)

- do not be afraid to upgrade a good 5 card suit to the next level (e.g. 14 hcp and 5 cards might open 1NT)
- (advanced) similarly bad hands may sometimes be downgraded, e.g. 4--3--3--3 hands have less playing strength (e.g. 15
  hcp Jxxx KQx KQJ QJx - no aces, too many values in a short suit, poor 4 card suit)
- some 5--4--2--2 with long !cs/!ds + 4 major hands (consider rebid if open a suit)
- (advanced) 4--4--4--1 hands (a most awkward shape) with a singleton A/K is also often best treated as balanced, and
  singleton A/K in a 5--4--3--1 maybe best depending on rebid options
- partnerships may agree to open 6--3--2--2 long minor hands 1NT, usually something good in the short suits and a minor
  that is not worth a 3 level jump rebid (may have points but poor suit)

* 2C Opening

- artificial, very good hands, too strong for a 1 level opening
- 23--24 balanced, the only non game forcing (GF) hand
- any game forcing (GF) hand

What is a game forcing opening?

- roughly any 22+ hcp unbalanced
- any 25+ hcp balanced hand
- any hand one trick short of game with 16+ hcp or better, 9 tricks for a major, 10 tricks for a minor
- the requirement for 16+ hcp should mean the hand has some defensive values / quick tricks (Aces / Kings etc. that can
  be won straight away)

Responding:

- easiest thing to remember would be to always bid 2D which gives opener space to describe their hand, but we employ
  some positive responses here
- responder only takes up bidding space if they have something useful to say, so the 2D response includes 8+ hcp hands
  without a 5 card suit
- when supporting opener's suit (e.g. after 2!c--2!d--2!s), bidding game quickly shows a weaker hand because you are
  already in a game force. This is called "fast arrival"

2C = artificial strong

* Takeout Doubles

- an opening hand with support for other suits, particularly majors. Maybe bit weaker if partner passed or good support
  for all suits
- power double, too strong to overcall 1N
- power double, too strong to make a normal suit overcall (e.g. more than ~8--16 hcp)

** When Takeout?

When these are all true double is takeout:

- 1st or 2nd round of bidding
- only suits bid
- we have not agreed any trump suit

There maybe a few other places where double is takeout, but they are explicitly mentioned below...

Opponents open and respond naturally, we double for the first time. This includes 1N and 2N responses, which is
different to the general rule of double is takeout when they only bid suits:

- (1!h)--P--(1!s)--X
- (1!d)--P--(2!c)--X
- (1!s)--P--(2!h)--X
- (1!d)--P--(1N)--X
- (1!c)--P--(2N)--X

The "responsive" takeout double situation where partner does a takeout double and they raise. Note at 3S or higher a
responsive takeout double maybe more general values showing:

- (1!d)--X--(3!d)--X
- (1!h)--X--(2!h)--X
- (1!s)--X--(3!s)--X
- (1!c)--X--(4!c)--X

A second takeout showing extra values (16+) when partner passed and the opposition compete:

- (1!h)--X--(2!h)--P--(P)--X
- (1!d)--X--(2!d)--P--(3!d)--X
- (1!c)--X--(1!s)--P--(2!s)--X

A double after we overcall when partner passes and the opposition compete:

- (1!h)--1S--(2!h)--P--(P)--X
- (1!h)--1S--(2!d)--P--(2!h)--X
- (1!h)--1S--(3!h)--P--(P)--X
- (1!d)--1H--(1!s)--P--(2!d)--X

Our side opens, the opposition overcall up to 4!h and partner doubles. At the 1 level it promises 4+ cards in any unbid
major. Known as the "negative" double:

- 1D--(1!h)--X  (exactly 4!ss, bid 1!s with 5+)
- 1D--(1!s)--X
- 1H--(1!s)--X
- 1C--(2!h)--X
- 1D--(3!s)--X

Opposition open, we overcall, responder bids a new suit after which advancer doubles. Another form of "responsive"
takeout double where we have tolerance for partner's overcalled suit:

- (1!h)--1S--(2!c)--X
- (1!c)--1H--(2!d)--X
- (1!s)--2D--(2!h)--X

* Penalty Doubles

If the double is definitely not a takeout double then by default it is for penalty, or at least showing values in the
suit bid.

** When Penalty?

Opposition open or overcall a natural NT bid, then later doubles are penalty:

- (1N)--X
- 1H--(1N)--X
- 2D--(2N)--X

We open a natural NT:

- 1N--(2!h)--X
- 2N--(3!d)--X
- 1N--(P)--P--(2!h)--X
- 1N--(P)--P--(2!s)--P--(P)--X

Partner takeout doubles, they bid a new suit OR NT, then double is penalty. Recall double is takeout if we initially
overcalled instead doubled for takeout:

- (1!d)--X--(2!c)--X
- (1!h)--X--(2!d)--X
- (1!s)--X--(2!h)--X
- (1!h)--X--(3!c)--X
- (1!h)--X--(1N)--X
- (1!d)--X--(2N)--X

Artificial bids, which we double for lead (but can defend for penalty if they decide to play in that suit):

- (1N)--P--(2!c)--X
- (1!h)--P--(1!s)--P--(2!d)--P--(3!c)--X  (FSF)

We have already redoubled to show values:

- 1S--(X)--XX--(2!d)--X
- 1N--(X)--XX--(2!h)--X

We open any preempt:

- 2D--(2!s)--X
- 2H--(3!d)--X
- 4C--(4!s)--X

+ Any 3rd round or later auction

* Slam Bidding

** Roman Keycard Blackwood

A 4N bid that asks for a count of the 4 Aces + King of trumps. "1430" responses (which is the score for making 6!h/6!s
vulnerable).

- 5!c = 1 or 4 kc
- 5!d = 3 or 0 kc
- 5!h = 2 kc
- 5!s = 2kc with Q trumps (or known 10+ trump cards)
- 5N = 2 or 4 kc + some useful void
- 6x = 1 or 3 kc + void in specific suit
- 6slam = odd kc + void in higher suit

*** 5NT King Ask after RKB

Show ask for specific kings (not count of Kings), with all 5 keycards held by our side

- 6x = lowest side K, 1 or 2 Kings
- 6slam = no side K
- 6N = 3 Kings

*** Queen Ask after RKB 5CD Response

The *next bid* up that is *not the trump suit* asks for the trump queen

- trump = bid our trump suit without it
- 5N = yes, but no side suit Kings
- otherSuit = yes trump queen, shows King in that side suit

*** New Suit 3rd Round Control Ask for Grand

When not a queen asks and not a king ask we are looking for 3rd round control of the bid suit to play in a grand slam.

A 3rd round control is a doubleton (or singleton/void) shortage or perhaps a queen. Something that will stop us losing a
trick after the Ace then King have been played.

** Control Cue Bids

- Once a suit is set as trumps, a new suit bid above 3 of the trump suit (if a major) or 3NT (if a minor) is a cue bid showing a control in the suit bid.
- We can show either first or second round controls (A, K, singleton or void).
- We bid the next control we have ‘up the line’. If we bypass a suit, we are denying a control (first or second round). We should abandon making slam tries if both members of the partnership are missing controls in the same suit.
- We can cue bid below game without promising extra values.
- If partner misses a suit and we continue to cuebid, it guarantees a control in the suit that partner missed.

*** special agreements

- If we jump in a cue-bidding sequence, this explicitly shows a void.
- If we don't have space but have a hand which wishes to encourage slam, we can make a cuebid in the last suit before
  game without promising a control. This is known as 'Last Train'

**** Serious 3N

This convention separates hands with normal values that are just cooperating with partner in case they have slam try
values from hands that have serious interest in slam. Serious only applies to major fits.

- we must have a 9+ card fit with game try values OR 8+ card fit with GF values
- both players must be clear that a major suit is agreed as trumps

In such auctions bidding 3N shows serious slam interest whilst skipping past 3N and just cue bidding is more cooperative
with fewer values.

Either player can use serious 3N but most of the time it is opener doing the serious 3N bid as their 1 level opening
bids are very wide ranging in hcp and playing strength. Sometimes opener is limited though and responder is wide
ranging, e.g. after a 1N opening. Examples:

- 1M--3M
- 1M--2N--3x  (Jacoby 2N then shown extras, but still a wide range)
- 1N--2D/2H--Transfer Break
- 1M--2x--2M--3M
- 1M--2x--2y--2M/3M


** What is 4N?

*** RKB 4N Situations

- anytime after we have agreed a suit
- after a natural suit bid by partner, except Stayman/Transfers, then 4N with or without competition

*** Natural Invitational 4N Situations

"Quantitative".

- after any natural NT opening or rebid that shows a balanced hand with a known point range (if the point range is very
  wide, e.g. 4/5+, then it is not very helpful)
- natural NT bid, followed by Stayman/Transfers, then 4N
- to show relevant maximum extras to an artificial fourth suit forcing call

*** Two Suited 4N Situations

Typically 5--5+ and usually the two lowest suits. When forced to bid by partner then may just be scrambling, offering a
choice of two lower suits, maybe only 4--4.

- over the opposition's 3 or 4 level bids (often a weak opening or a normal opening then raise)
- responding to a takeout double
- after opened or overcalled a minor, partner quiet, then 4N in competition with a very strong hand

* Carding

Not a bidding agreement, but put here as it forms a part of the overall system.

** Opening Leads

- top of honour sequences / interior sequences: (K)Qxxx, K(10)9x
- 4 highest leads from honours, including treating 10 an as honour: K10x(x), Axx(x)x
- low from Hxx
- 2nd from 4 small cards: x(x)xx
- MUD, middle up down from 3 small: x(x)x
- high low from doubleton: (x)x, but K from AK
- Q is KQ or QJ depending on the signal we want
- K at NT asks for unblock of an honour from a strong holding such as KQJx+, KQ109+
- K at trumps just asks for count

** Signals

- AQ leads asks for an attitude signal
- K leads ask for count at suit, unblock or count at NT
- otherwise we show count on partner's lead where we are not trying to win the trick
- when just following the suit declarer plays and not trying to win we give count

There are some standard situations where suit preference signals take priority:

- leading to give partner a ruff (what do we want returned?)
- partner is winning but declarer or dummy are known to have a singleton
- count already known in that suit


The system is standard high encouraging / low discouraging for attitude and high-low even / low-high odd for count signals.
You can also agree to play low encouraging / high discouraging.

** Discards

Initial first discard is standard attitude: high like suit, low dislike suit.

Later discards, remaining count, but possibly attitude or even suit preference if we think that's what they need to
know.
