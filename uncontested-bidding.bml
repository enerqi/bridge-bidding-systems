* 1D Opening

Short / Nebulous !d for flattish or 3 suited or both minors or extreme shape maximum 6+!d and 5!h/!s hands.

- Zero plus !d cards
- 11--13 balanced/semi-balanced hands with 2+ card !d suit (poor vulnerable 11 hcp flat may pass)
- 11--13 balanced hands in principle do not include any 5 card major hands
- 11--15 unbalanced 3 suiter (4--4--4--1 / 5--4--4--0 / 5--4--3--1) any short suit and without a 5 card major, so maybe minor canapé
- 11--15 both minors 5--4 / 5--5 (6--5 maximum could also use for more space), so maybe minor canapé.
- Rare extreme shape hands with extras include 6(7)!d--5!h/!s

Other bids:

- Often open [2!c](#2C Intermediate Opening)/[2!d](#2D Intermediate Opening) with minimum 6--5 both minors and 2!c with 6--6 minor hands
- A maximum 6--5 minors can be supported by 1!d or the 2!c/2!d openings, experiment
- Open [2!d](#2D Intermediate Opening) with a 7!d--4!h/!s hand
- Improvise with 8!d--4!h/!s, probably best to open higher with 2!d expecting competition. It's a very rare 1:2211 frequency anyway.
- [Open 1!c](#1C Weak Strong) with any 14--15 weak NT like hand, including many 5--4--2--2 five card !c/!d hands
- Open [1!h](#1H Opening) or [1!s](#1S Opening) with an 11--13 hcp 5--3--3--2 major, unless willing to pretend it is a 4 card suit
- Open [1!h](#1H Opening) or [1!s](#1S Opening) with a minimum 6!d and 5 card !h/!s hand and bid like a 5--5 hand

*** 1D--1H--1N

- 11--13, which maybe offshape with shortage in partner's major or semi-balanced

**** Opener's cue bid

When partner bids 1!h/!s and the opponent bids (double or overcall) at the 1 level, or
with less nuance if they bid at the 2 level.

1D--(P)--1H--(1S)
    2S = best invitational !h raise, maximum and shape
    3H = weak limit (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)
    others = system on (only one opp bid, space available)

1D--(1H)--X--(P)
    1S = nothing special
    2H = best invitational 4 card !s support
    2S = weak limit (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)
    others = system on (only one opp bid, space available)

1D--(1H)--1S--(P)  showing !cs
    2C = nothing special
    2H = best invitational 4 card !c support, maximum and shape
    3C = weak limit !c raise (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)

Still on if 2nd position overcalls and advancer only bids 1N/2!c/2!d in 4th.

1D--(1H)--1S--(1N/2C/2D)
    X = 3 card support double, not rubbish if forced 3 level
    2C = 4 card support, often dead minimum
    2H = best invitational 4 card !c support, maximum and shape
    3C = weak limit !c raise (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)

When they only overcall 2x then our cue bid is less nuanced at the 3 level. It is NOT a
stopper ask, as only natural invitational 3!d rebids (e.g. xx/Axx/AKQJxx/xxx) would benefit.

1D--(P)--1S--(2C)
    3C = good 3!s raise
    3S = weaker !s raise
    X = support, not rubbish VUL
    others = system on (only one opp bid, space available)


**** Support doubles and redoubles by opener

- responder's 1 level bid shows a suit (often 1H/1S but could be an artificial minor showing bid)
- 4th hand bids, even NT bids
- 2nd hand's bid is irrelevant
- opener can X/XX or do a direct raise
- not required with xxx, especially with good defensive holdings
- responder's continuations are natural - NF 1N (maybe no stop) or 2 level bid, invitational 2N or 3 level, cue bid only GF
- normal raises are usually 4 cards, though may want to bid with 3 cards to protect an honour, e.g. 1!d--(1!h)--X--(2!h)--2!s

1D--(X)--1H--(1N)
    X = support double, 3 card support (!ss)
    raise = 4 card support (!s in this case as 1!h shows !ss)

1D--(P)--1H--(2C)--X--(P)
    2D = NF 3+ !ds, considering something better than a 4--3 !h fit
    2H = NF natural
    2S = natural 4--4 majors, forcing, invitational plus

Extended to the 3 level, (note penalty unlikely with an artificial 1!c system) but with more strength/shape:

1D--(1S)--X--(2S)
    X = support double, 14--15 hcp
    2N = good bad
    3H = 4 card support, 11--13

Extended through to 4!h, again more strength needed so not doubling does not deny 3 card support:

1D--(X)--1H--(3H)
    X = support, 3 card support (for the !s transfer suit here), shapely maximum
        4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N) for Major
        4thSuit = unspecified slam try

Includes 4th hands bids where 2nd hand does not bid at all:

1D--(P)--1S--(4H)
    X = support


**** Extra trump redouble after settling in 2HS

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener shows 4 card support as may have raised with only 3 cards

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

**** Good-Bad 2N over 2DHS interference by 4th hand

- Good-Bad 2N is usually strong/good support or a bad/worse lower suit bid
- As a 1!d opener cannot have a long single suit, bad/worse will be both minors

1D--(any)--any--(2DHS)
    2N = Good-Bad with strong support or weaker minors hand (e.g. 5--4 14--15)
    3CD = minors 5--5+, maximum

**** Choice of game 4x cue bids after Thrump double

- Iff our side shown values and not found a fit, constructive auction
- Actual cue bid or bid of suit they've artificially indicated
- always at least two places to play
- maybe slam try later, but assumed not

1D--(3!d)--X
    4D = choice of game, likely 3--3 majors

1D--(3!h)--X
    4H = choice of game, e.g. 4!h cue showing 3 card !s suit OR pick a minor ask
        4S = at least 5!ss
            4N = both minors, probably better !ds
            5C = both minors, better !cs

By responder example:

1D--(3!h)--X--(P)
    4C = opener's rebid
        4H = unsure of minor
            4S = 3 card support for !s
            5C = 5 good !cs, medium !ds
            5D = 5 very good !ds

** 1H--1S

- maybe weak !d canapé, as well as any strength
- NOT weak with long 6/7 !cs, usually better to bid 1N so can escape to !cs over a 2D rebid when 4--1--2--6 / 4--1--1--7
- in-between hands uncertain of level likely to show 3 card !h support immediately
- 4 !ss + 3+ card !h support is possible with GF values - it's easier to control the auction

** 1H--2H

Single raise, 3 cards

- 3 card raises ~8--10 support points
- 2M is semi-constructive (only 1N could be gambling semi-preemptive extra weak on occasion)
- 2M by passed hands is unconstructive (use drury for better hands)
- 4 carders worse than a mixed raise should bid 1N, rarely passed out
- also use the "semi" forcing 1NT for the 3 card game invite or weaker 3 card raises

- may include 3 card limit raise hands ~(5)--7 support points or 3 card invitational ~11--12 support points
- may include weak 4 card raises ~4--7 support that are not worth a mixed raise

Responding:

- The 2!c Gazilli variant response makes it impossible to play 2!c
- Gazilli also makes a 2!d sign off over 2!c impossible, though a 3!c/!d signoff is available
- minimum 5!h + 4!c hands should usually pass, given the lack of space after the artificial 2H rebid

** 1H--2C

Nebulous 2/1 GF 2C -- natural or balanced 2+ !cs (3-card Reverse Drury by passed hand)

- includes GF flattish hands with 3 card major support
- rebids are Bergen shape showing style
- 2D rebids are natural, unlike in wide ranging standard systems where 2D is often natural OR minimum balanced (or just
  stop missing in some styles)
- 2N rebids shows a (semi)balanced hand, does not promise stops, Bergen style. The specific point range makes judging
  when to quantitative raise 4N easier

- Versus a passed hand, bids above 2!h are GF
- 2!h rebid versus a passed hand is 2!h (fast arrival) with a (sub)minimum hand

  if looking for support for the suit from partner
- Note, Picture raises are used after a 2/1 new suit
- Consider if a 4 card raise is suitable for a splinter, there are two ranges ~10--12 hcp and 13--15 hcp
- With game values and almost no chance of slam consider bidding game directly
- The system allows strong 16+ hcp splinter responders to bid 2N then show their shortage

** 1H--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support, denying !ss

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits might bid 1N, then signoff, or just pass
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

- New suit by opener is extreme two suiter slam try.
- Almost always wrong to bid game with 5--3--3--2/5--4--2--2.
- Responder's 5--4--2--2 is good due to the two shortages for ruffing and potential long suit to setup

** 1H--3S

Unknown singleton splinter, 10--12 hcp (~9--10 by passed hand)

Splinter bids typically have fairly evenly distributed strength amongst the side suits as otherwise a 2/1 GF bid

** 1S--2S

Single raise, 3 cards

- 3 card raises ~8--10 support points
- 2M is semi-constructive (only 1N could be gambling semi-preemptive extra weak on occasion)
- 2M by passed hands is unconstructive (use drury for better hands)
- 4 carders worse than a mixed raise should bid 1N, rarely passed out
- also use the "semi" forcing 1NT for the 3 card game invite or weaker 3 card raises


2N = general game try, not exposing opener
    3CDH = natural trial bid, e.g. Qxxx KQxx xx xxx, cooperating - unsure of game
        3x = more trial bids if necessary

** 1S--2N

One of:

- 4+ card GF raise
- 4 card limit raise
- rare 3 card distributional invite (e.g. 6--3--3--1 distribution)

- maximum game accept hands typically 6 losers
- With game values and 3 card support, use either the Nebulous 2C response or bid a 5 card side suit with slam interest
  if looking for support for the suit from partner
- Note, Picture raises are used after a 2/1 new suit
- Consider if a 4 card raise is suitable for a splinter, there are two ranges ~10--12 hcp and 13--15 hcp
- With game values and almost no chance of slam consider bidding game directly
- The system allows strong 16+ hcp splinter responders to bid 2N then show their shortage

*** Interference

[See 1H--2N Invite Plus Interference examples](#2N Invite Plus Interference)


** 1S--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support, denying !hs

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits might bid 1N, then signoff, or just pass
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

*** 1S--3C

3D = stopper, not natural necessarily, e.g. AJxxx/xxx/AQ/Axx wanting !h stop
3H = stopper, quasi-natural, responder can raise without 4th suit stopper and 3/4 card support
3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = forcing, !c slam try
4D = splinter for !cs
4H = splinter for !cs
4S = to play

*** 1S--3D

Similar to 1!h--3!c:

3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = implied cue bid
4D = forcing, !d slam try
4H = splinter for !ds
4S = to play

*** 1S--3H

3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = implied cue bid
4D = implied cue bid
4HS = to play

** 1S--3S

Mixed raise (weak limit raise) -- ~8--10 support points, 4+ cards

- New suit by opener is extreme two suiter slam try.
- Almost always wrong to bid game with 5--3--3--2/5--4--2--2.
- Responder's 5--4--2--2 is good due to the two shortages for ruffing and potential long suit to setup

** 1S--3N

Unknown singleton splinter, 10--12 hcp (~9--10 by passed hand)

Splinter bids typically have fairly evenly distributed strength amongst the side suits as otherwise a 2/1 GF bid
of the strong suit is often better (unless the strong suit is mostly self-sufficient).

4C = ask
    4D = !d shortage
    4H = !h shortage
    4S = !c shortage

** 1S--4C/4D/4H

Maximum splinter, short !c/!d/!h, upper-tier ~13--15 hcp (could GF without a shortage)
(Fit jump by passed hand)

** 1S--4S

To play, always. Could be highly obstructive and weak with long trumps or a fast arrival minimum flattish game bid.
