#+TITLE: Natural intermediate 2C Opening

* 2C Intermediate Opening

2!c = 10+--15 hcp, 6+ card !c suit. Maybe leading directing 5 card !c suit in 3rd.

- good 10 hcp only, working honours
- By judgement, open 1!c with 5--4--2--2, 5!c + 4 card major and (13)--15.
- By judgement, Open 1!c with 6--3--2--2 semi-balanced max without 2/3 top honours
- Open 1!d with 5--4--2--2 and both minors, by judgement possibly 1!c with honours in the doubletons and (13)--15.
- By judgement, Open 1NT with 5--4--2--2, 5!c + 4 card major and 16 hcp, possibly with 17--18 aswell.
- Open 1!d with 5!c and a two or three suiter without a 5 card major
- 6!c and 5!d (probably a maximum) may choose to open 1!d to use the extra bidding space
- 6!c and 5!h/!s minimum may by judgement show a 5--5 hand opening 1!h/1!s before showing !cs

Responding:

- 2!h/2!s and 3!h/!s are NF natural bids. Beware opener may rebid their suit with a singleton over 2!h/!s and take
  the auction to the 3 level - pass can be safer though looking for a major can score better at match points.
- 2N includes some good GF major hands and the 3!c transfer bid is for any !d focussed hand. Most other
  *invitational plus hands* including the !c slam try use the *2!d enquiry*.
- Hands with one or both majors and invitational plus values can use 2!d but be willing to go to game despite potential
  misfits if opener is non-minimum.
- 2N can puppet to a 3!c preempt. 4!c is a preempt. Again invitational !cs go via the 2!d enquiry.
- 3!d (5--5+ majors invite+) is artificial. Note the option with < GF values + 5--5 majors + 2/3 !cs may bid 2!d.
