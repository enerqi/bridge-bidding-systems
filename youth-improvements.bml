#+TITLE: Improving the Youth Bridge System

* Overview

A large selection of bidding system improvements after becoming comfortable with the
[baseline natural 5--5--4--2, strong NT, three suit weak two bids bidding system](https://sublime.is/squad-system.html).
Mostly in a reference guide format rather than detailed teaching material.

It is not expected that partnerships will add all of these, especially not in one go! The ordering gives a hint at what
maybe the most useful for the smallest effort ("bang for buck") - some of the early material is more about agreeing a
style with partner than learning lots of new ideas and content. Some new ideas have clear tradeoffs to consider.


* Preempt Styles

A long bit of (somewhat advanced) background theory. This helps you pick your own partnership style - both partners
should ideally be clear on their preempt style.

Preempts are fun! They annoy the opponents by taking up their bidding space. Maybe they miss a game or play the wrong
part score. Maybe they let us play a contract, making or not, when they should have bid something. Maybe the preempt
helps us sacrifice (bid higher than the opponents' contract whilst not expecting to make the contract, but not lose too many points).
Maybe the preempt directs partner to the right lead against their contract that sends it off.

Why are there style considerations? Any preempt (weak opening bid) also preempts our partner, taking away room from our
side to bid constructively to a different game or slam contract. Some preempts are poor enough that there's a reasonable
chance that we go off a lot. Even undoubled a preempt that goes off 2 or 3 can be a very bad score - such as when we are
vulnerable and the opponents had no chance of making a game.

*** What is the typical default weak two style?

- shows 6 cards (maybe a very bad 7 card suit with minimum points)
- shows at least 2 honours
- does not have another 4 card major (we may have a fit with partner in the other major)
- shows a specific point range, i.e. 5--9 hcp
- implicitly a specific point range size, i.e. 5--9 hcp is a 5 point range

*** What happens when we change some of these style guidelines?

- If you bid a weak two with 5 OR 6 cards then the tricking taking potential of your hand changes a lot, but you open
  more often
- If you open with a wider range e.g. 5--10/11 hcp then it's harder to respond, but you open more often
- If you open with only 1 honour or even zero honours, it's harder to respond and harder to know whether we should lead
  that suit, but you open more often
- If you open with a side 4 card major, it's harder to judge whether to play the weak two suit, the other major or NT,
  but you open more often

So, clearly you get to open more often by having a more wide ranging open style. This can be fun, at least for a while,
but can also be frustrating when it's too hard for responder to judge what contract to play in!

*** What is the role of position?

Position is crucial. We should be varying our style in at least two ways:

- 1st position: play our partnership's "standard" style, whatever that is agreed to be
- 2nd position: play our most sensible "standard" style, one opponent has already passed so there's a 50% chance to
  preempt partner instead of the opponents
- 3rd position: bid more aggressively and allow a wider more open style because partner has already passed and we are
  weak, so the opponents have most of the points
- 4th position: not often considered, but in 4th a weak two should actually be an "intermediate" two bid, a good 6 card
  suit with around 10--13 hcp. This stops the opponents making a balancing overcall with weaker hands and potentially
  forcing us to bid to the 3 level (less a concern if you have the !s suit)

Most partnerships can simply consider:

- 1st/2nd position standard style
- 3rd position aggressive style!

But...

*** What is the role of vulnerability?

When VUL going two off undoubled is usually a bad score!

- VUL then better suit quality is more important. It would be hard to escape to a better contract! If we are lacking
  honours in our main suit then our hand maybe too defensive with values in side suit(s) or it may have support for
  partner's suit
- NV suit quality is less important, we just have to know what to expect from partner

There's more though, it's not just our vulnerability that can matter:

- NV vs VUL then the opposition may get a big VUL game bonus
- VUL vs NV it's the other way round. We don't want to preempt our own bidding space and miss that game

These are more concerned with IMPs scoring. Despite the notion that 2nd position is sound/sensible, at IMPs
bidding aggressively NV vs VUL puts pressure on the opposition looking for their VUL game bonus.

*** What is the role of scoring?

At IMPs (mostly teams based matches) the size of the numbers is important. At matchpoints (mostly pairs competitions)
you are just trying to do better than others and if you get a terrible score on one board it only affects that one hand.
A minus 800/1100 score from a doubled contract on one hand at IMPs can create a huge IMP loss that could take many good
scores on other boards to recover from. That said, many minus 200 scores over a few boards at matchpoints will gradually
add up to a poor score, so a style that leads to regular overbidding when vulnerable is dangerous whatever the scoring.

- when vulnerable be sensible at both IMPs and MPs, but especially so at IMPs
- when non-vulnerable at IMPs it may pay to be extra aggressive to keep the opponents out of their game, especially
  when they are vulnerable (and would get a larger bonus for making game)
- when non-vulnerable at MPs your extra aggression is less rewarded, the opponents do not benefit as much from bidding
  games

Overall position is more important than the scoring, but it still needs considering. If you are extra aggressive in
non-vulnerable 1st/2nd at IMPs then you risk your partner overbidding (unless it's an agreed style).


*** Ways to Add Aggression (usually in 3rd position)

- Fewer cards. 5 cards at the 2 level, 6 cards at 3 level, 7 cards at the 4 level etc.

Bidding with fewer cards has to be considered against how many tricks you may lose if going off in your contract. For
that reason you may have a more shapely hand, e.g. 6--4--2--1 if attempting a 3 level preempt or 5--5--2--1 for a 2
level vulnerable preempt

- Bidding with a side 4 card major

Unless your weak two responses have a special structure to look for a side 4 card major suit, and even then, this can be
hard to constructively bid over to the correct contract. However, if your suit can play well opposite a singleton then
it may not matter that you missed a contract in the other major. Naturally, if partner has already passed we don't need
to be constructive.

- Fewer honour requirements

1 top honour is not as good as 2 honours. 1 honour including the Jack or maybe the 10 is even worse etc.

One top honour is a playable style when matched with a tight point range (no wider than 4 points) and it naturally
helps you to open more often. Partner is now less sure of whether we should be leading that suit or sacrificing,
particularly if you play an even more aggressive style.

Playing very weak honour styles can make your weak two responses more complicated:

- should partner be thinking about your shape more (do you have a singleton and where is it?)
- where are your values (stops in side suits instead of strength in your long suit)?
- should partner ask you whether you have good (2+ honours) or bad suit?

Too many values in side suits may make 3N the best game contract, but maybe those values are in the wrong place and what
you think is a maximum weak two should really be called a minimum because your poor suit will take longer to set up
tricks.

When the opening is always good (2+ honours) then we may be able to look for a cheap game by finding out if they have
a singleton in a specific suit (with some different responses).

- Wider point range

Bid more often, but harder to respond to. Now you may want your weak two response to be able to ask the weak two opener
if they have a minimum, medium or maximum hand (not just minimum v.s. maximum) and it's harder to get any other
information from them without going to game.

- Flatter hands

A shortage adds playing strength, 6--3--3--1 is quite a bit better than 6--3--2--2.

5--4--3--1 is better than 5--4--2--2. 5--3--3--2 is terrible, even in 3rd position think hard about it.

Opening the flatter hands across you entire weak two point range makes your bidding more aggressive.


*** Ways to Reduce Aggression (usually in 1st/2nd)

To make your preempt easier to respond to:

- do not have 2 Aces with a near maximum point count hand, or if you do then have no singleton and no side King
- do not have 3 cards with 2 honours in the other major (perhaps you don't have enough strength in your long suit)
- do not have values in 3 suits, they should be more concentrated in your suit
- keep the point range fairly small, e.g. 4 point range, not wider ones like 5--9 / 4--9 / 5--10 etc.
- require shortages for the lowest end of your point range
- follow the default 2 honours requirement or even increase it to be 2 "top" honours (Ace, King or Queen), perhaps 3 of
  top 5 (include J and 10)
- decide when to open a 6 card suit at the one level...

Having no gap between your weak two bids and 1 level openings actually helps you to be constructive and to bid more!
Having a hand too good to open a weak two and too bad to open at the one level makes no sense. This may happen if your
normal point range is quite low, e.g. 6--9 hcp (so what about 10 hcp?), and you cannot see it as worth upgrading to a 1
level opening.

Why can we bid more by having no gap here? Hands closer to 10 hcp are more frequent than e.g. 5 or 6 hcp (those are less
frequent). For that reason choosing a 7--10 hcp range maybe better than a common 6--9 hcp range. For this very reason,
partnerships may play a weak two opening as 8--11 hcp - it makes their 1 level opening bids more constructive - when they show a 6
card major their partner knows they have 12+ points (again, perhaps 11 hcp if they have 2 Aces or a singleton).

*** How to choose whether to upgrade a hand on the border, e.g. 10 hcp when playing a 7--10 hcp range?

- suit is very good (AK or 3 honours)
- suit is good and you have a singleton
- suit is good and comes with a side King or Ace (control heavy), particularly with values in your long suits
- shape is extra special, i.e a singleton plus a doubleton, or a void (6--4--2--1 / 6--4--3--0), which hits rule of 20
  openings anyway. Such 9 hcp hands may want upgrading if the suit quality is there
- maybe not if there are wasted points in short suits (e.g. Queens / Jacks)
- position and vulnerability suggest the opening is sound or aggressive, e.g. if 2nd VUL and playing sound openings a
  good 10 hcp is ok


END PREEMPT STYLE THEORY

** Recommended Preempt Style Alteration?

This balances your ability to preempt frequently with partner being able to respond constructively:

- (1) remove any gap between 2 level and one level openings, e.g. 6/7--10 hcp
- (2) keep the overall hand strength range tight in 1st/2nd - either 7--10 hcp or 6--10 where you require a shortage
  with 6 hcp point. Readily upgrade many good maximums to a 1 level opening
- (3) factor in 1st/2nd v.s. 3rd position.
- (4) NV agree to open hands with only 1 top honour
- (5) IMPs NV vs VUL 2nd position, consider more aggressive bids
- (6) consider mixed 5 or 6 card Weak Twos as a bonus step

You will play against some pairs whose philosophy is that making responder's life difficult (through very aggressive
openings in 1st/2nd) does not matter as long as we might make it hard for the opponents. The problem is that too much
randomness / variance may not lead too many good scores. In 1st position you can argue that there's a 1
in 3 chance you are preempting partner, so have a 2 in 3 chance of annoying the opponents instead. As mentioned, one
terrible board at IMPs teams scoring, can take many good boards to recover from, so perhaps save the wildness for
matchpoints when you are non-vulnerable.

The other end of the spectrum is that if your preempts are too perfect, then you will be very predictable and won't open
very often, at which point you might have something better to do with those opening bids.

** Non-Vulnerable Mixed 5 or 6 card Weak Twos

5 card weak twos occur roughly 3:2 as often as 6 card weak twos.

You can keep playing 3 suit weak twos in 1st, 2nd and 3rd position but choose to open with 5 card majors when
non-vulnerable in 1st (maybe 2nd on agreement). If you read the theory section, it shouldn't come as a surprise if your
partner already opens a 5 card weak two in 3rd position when non-vulnerable (and sometimes even vulnerable)!

The weak two can be 5 OR 6 cards, which makes it harder for partner to bid constructively to a game. If you do play
optional 5 card weak twos mixed in with 6 card weak twos at the same time then some quality standards for the 5 carders
in 1st (especially 2nd!) is recommended:

- do not have a wide point range, e.g. keep to 6--9 / 7--10 / 8--11 hcp
- never open with a 5--3--3--2 balanced hand
- usually have a singleton, if 5--4--2--2 semi-balanced then have a maximum and beware downgrade Q/J honours in short
  suits
- have 2+ honours, top honours unless the spot cards look good aswell

This style suggests only 5 card !hs and !ss. You do not want to preempt 2D with a side 4 card major in 1st/2nd (though
this is an aggressive option some have played), which leaves 5!ds and 4+ !cs as the only hand shape with a 5 card !d
suit. It's probably more helpful to know that partner definitely has 6!ds. Alternatively, see the sections about the
Multi 2D further below.

*** Mixed 5 or 6 card Weak Twos Adjusted Responses

We can continue playing the same responses as standard weak twos (e.g. with Ogust can treat any 5 carder as a bad suit),
but it often helps to find out whether partner has 5 or 6 cards!

When partner only has 5 cards we may find a fit in the other major, which requires knowing whether they have 3 card
support along with their 5 card weak suit. These responses allow responder to choose a major suit to slam try in, not
just the weak two opener's suit. The downside is that we've lost 4CD as a cue bid when slam searching. Preempts can
preempt ourselves.

2HS--2N = artificial ask, invitational plus hands (roughly 15+ hcp opposite 6--9 hcp weak twos)
    3C = any 5 carder
        3D = ask
            3H = minimum
            3S = maximum, 0--2 card other major
            3N = maximum + 3 card other major support
        3M = sign off
        4C = !h slam try
        4D = !s slam try
        4HS = to play
        4N = keycard blackwood
    3D = minimum, 6 carder
        3oM = 5 cards, forcing
        3M = sign off
        4C = !h slam try
        4D = !s slam try
        4HS = to play
        4N = keycard blackwood
    3H = medium (hcp or bad suit issues), 6 carder
        4C = !h slam try
        4D = !s slam try
        4HS = to play
        4N = keycard blackwood
    3S = maximum, 6 carder + 0--2 card other major
        4C = !h slam try
        4D = !s slam try
        4HS = to play
        4N = keycard blackwood
    3N = maximum, 6 carder + 3 card other major support
        4C = !h slam try
        4D = !s slam try
        4HS = to play
        4N = keycard blackwood
    4HS = 7 carder, bad suit (not worth 3!h!s opening)

* Weak Two Responses

After considering your [preempt style](#Preempt Styles) and agreeing it with your partner you may want to research some
different responses that fit with that style. Without a well defined style there's little point in worrying about
different weak two responses.

** Feature Ask

2HS--2N
    3x = side feature (Ace or King or QJ), maximum
    3M = minimum
    3N = (advanced) maximum, no feature, 6--3--2--2
    4M = (advanced) maximum, no feature, some shortage

Perhaps the easiest and what most people learn first (though the 3N and 4M responses are made up here ... we could play 4!c/4!d
as shortage in those specific suits). This may help you bid 3N or 4HS when you find opener can help you in a specific
suit. This starts from the assumption that the opening suit is reasonable quality, so we may assume e.g. 2 honours in
the long suit.

This doesn't work very well with mixed 5 or 6 card openings. It could be adjusted to work with 5 card only weak twos.

** Mixed 5 or 6 Length Ask

See the suggested [Mixed 5 or 6 card Weak Twos Adjusted Responses](#Mixed 5 or 6 card Weak Twos Adjusted Responses) from
the preempt styles section. This assumes you have a sensible good 5 carders style and have at least a 1 top honour style
for the 6 carder. Keep the point range fairly narrow or the honour count at 2. Even with such restrictions it's always
fairly difficult with mixed length.

** Shortage / Strength

Anytime we focus on shortage, we assume it's a 6 card weak two (or know to be exactly 5 cards, but then side suit asks
describe the hand better) and it's presumably decent suit quality or not too wide range. The extra space gained by the
2H--2S asks loses the natural !s bid, and there's the chance we forget it is an ask. As a positive, we can find a
shortage from a complete minimum hand, which can get to some cheap games. It does reveal more about the hands, helping
defence though.

2H--2S as ask instead of 2N
    2N = short !ss, min
    3CD = shortage, min
    3H = no shortage, min
    3N = any max
        4C = shortage ask, slam try

2S--2N
    3CDH = shortage, min
    3S = no shortage, min
    3N = any max
        4C = shortage ask, slam try

** Vinny

Potential to find shortages and side suit fits for slam hunting or avoiding a bad 3N. Assumes a 6 card major. Also good
at not leaking too much information when choosing between 3M and game. That means there is no specific bid for shortage
and a minimum, though that is perhaps a "medium" hand if the suit isn't too bad. Whether you want to open a weak two
with 6--4 majors requires specific partnership agreement. You are certainly unlikely to ever open 5--4 majors in
1st/2nd!

2D--2N
    3C = maximum (not medium/max as over a major)
        3D = shortage ask, then cue bids for !ds
            3HS = shortage
            3N = no
        4C = Preempt Roman Keycard (if played normally)
    3D = minimum
        3H = shortage ask (not immediate control bids as over a major)
            3S = !s shortage
            3N = no
            4C = !c shortage
            4D = !h shortage (or 4H if forget)
    3H = 6--4 natural
        3S = !d slam try (lowest other suits flag slam try, natural if possible else ranked order)
        4C = !s slam try
    3S = 6--4 natural
        4C = !s slam try
        4D = !d slam try

2M--2N
  3C = like hand (relative to position/vulnerability), medium/maximum preempt
    3D = shortage ask (if 6--3--3--1 with 6 card weak twos)
      3oM = other major
      3M = no
      3N = !ds
      4C = !cs  (or whatever style you like to show specific suits, e.g. low/medium/high up the line)
    3M = NF, invitational
      P = medium (e.g. AKxxxx)
      4M = maximum (e.g. AQxxxx Kxx xxx x)
    4C = Preempt Roman Keycard (if played normally)
  3M = bad hand (relative to position/vulnerability)
  3D = 6--4 with !d side suit
    3M = major slam try
    4C = !d slam try
  3oM = 6--4 with other major side suit
    4C = lower major slam try
    4D = higher major slam try
  3N = 6--4 with !c side suit
    4C = !c slam try
    4D = major slam try

You can go a long way without worrying about how to set the slam try suit after showing a 6--4 hand. Perhaps learn that
later and you can choose whatever style you like for agreeing the slam try suit.


** Side Suit and Shortage Showing

Can show a side 4 card suit along with the (assumed) long 6 card suit. This can help find some slams via a double fit or
choose a trump game over 3N with a hole. If you are possibly opening a 5 card weak two non-vulnerable then perhaps agree
the side suit showing as 5--5, but overall these responses better fit 6 card only openings. Use a bid that finds out the
length if playing mixed 5 or 6.

The shortage showing treats any shortage as a medium/maximum hand - you can be bidding game even with a minimum in hcp,
therefore it's probably best played when you don't have a bad suit style. Leaks shortage information perhaps
unnecessarily.

2H--2N
    3C = 6--4 with some unknown side 4 card suit
        3D = suit ask
    3D = !c or !d (minor) shortage
    3M = minimum, no shortage
    3oM = shortage in the other major
    3N = max, no shortage
    4x = void

** Ogust

This is more for players who open bad suits. We only have room to check suit quality and points, so harder to mix in 5
with 6 card weak twos (though we may just call 5 cards a bad suit). The min/max boundary should probably consider more
than just points - whether there's a shortage or working honours etc. If it's a 5 card suit, which has less playing
strength, then a maximum should probably be top of range e.g. 9--10 hcp

2M--2N
    3C = minimum/bad suit
    3D = minimum/good suit
    3H = maximum/bad suit
    3S = maximum/good suit
    3N = AKQxxx


* Lebensohl - Defending Weak 2HS

** Problem

The opponents open a weak two major taking up your bidding space and partner does a takeout double. At this point you have
been forced to bid so it's hard to distinguish weak/bad hands from invitational or game forcing hands. There's also the
issue of finding 4--4 major fits, checking for stops when going to a 3N game or just finding a minor part score to play.

** Lebensohl Background

Lebensohl is often considered a complex convention. As a positive though, it can be played in many more situations than
just defending against weak two bids. However, there are a number of variations and the most practiced partnerships may
consider playing different variants in different situations, which just adds to the complexity.

Often Lebensohl is first learnt in the context of dealing with overcalls of our 1N bid and gives you ways to separate
invitational v.s. game forcing hands, with or without a 4 card major and with or without a stop. It uses 2N as an
artificial bid, so there is no natural invite bid available, but gets back many benefits in return. Recall in our base
system, if the opponents overcall 2H over our 1N opening:

1N--(2!h)
    Dbl = takeout (possibly penalty by agreement)
    2S = non-forcing
    2N = natural, stop
    cue = GF waiting, often stop asking or wants a 4 card major bid
    3x = natural, GF
    3N = natural, stop

This doesn't give us a way to show an invitational hand, but at least we've agreed that a 3H cue bid can be used to
check for a 4--4 major fit or ask for a stop. This system maybe good enough for most auctions even though it can be
improved with Lebensohl. However, when responding to a weak two takeout double it's more difficult and a frequent
occurence, especially against opponents with an aggressive weak two style. Therefore, this is suggested as the first
place to try Lebensohl.

Variants of Lebensohl come under a confusing array of names such as:

- Classic (2N puppet to show weak/competitive hands below opponents suit, invitational above, direct 3x GF)
- Reverse (direct 3x weak/competitive below opponents suit, invitational above, 2N puppet to show GF hands)
- Rubensohl/Rubinsohl (Rubens advances + Lebensohl, where 2N up to 3!s transfers are weak or GF, transfer to opponent's suit is staymanic cue)
- Transfer/Advanced (similar to Rubensohl but 2N bid is multi-meaning puppet any strength !cs or weak other suit, transfers are invitational plus)
- Rumpelsohl (transfers weak or GF, 2N multi-meaning used to show invitational hands)

Within those there could be minor variations around whether fast shows (a stop), slow shows (a stop via 2N first if 2N
is a multi-meaning puppet), slow/fast cue shows a 4 card major or not and stop asks, direct 3
level bids are strong or via 2N are strong etc. Transfers to the cue suit or transfer through it. Showing competitive
hands faster naturally sounds more matchpoint oriented. Focusing on invitational/GF hands better for IMPs.

If that all sounds like nonsense, no problem. We will look at Better Minor Lebensohl for dealing with 2HS preempt
takeouts.

Later we look at [Transfer Lebensohl](#Transfer Lebensohl Over 2 Level Interference) for most other situations and
["Reversed" Lebensohl](#Reversed Lebensohl) when partner is known to be unbalanced

** Solution

Better Minor Lebensohl, which may also be known as "Gucci Lebensohl".

- different hands are shown by bidding with or without the artificial 2N relay
- responder and the takeout doubler can have a wide range, responder is now forced to bid
- we have no bid to to show an invitational !c hand (you must guess game or part score), but we can escape to our best
  minor fit

Over a 2D weak two, 3C is always the better minor so it looks similar to normal Lebensohl.

    3D = natural, invitational
    3H = stop, 4!ss, GF
    3S = 5 card invitational
    3N = to play, stop, no other major
    4CD = natural, GF, unsuitable for 3N

(2S)--X
    2N = ask for better minor, but includes various hands
        3CD = better minor
            P = to play, opposite "normal" takeout double
            3DH = to play, weak hand
            3S = cue, 4!hs, GF with NO stop
            3N = NO stop, maybe 3!hs + 5/6 minor or both minors
        3H = natural, extra strength ~17+, 5+ card major bid
        3S = power double type strong hand, e.g. 5--4+
        3N = power double with stop
    3C = natural ~0--10 hcp, less than game accept values
    3DH = natural, invitational
    3S = stop, 4!hs, GF
    3N = to play, stop, no other major
    4CD = natural, GF, unsuitable for 3N
    4H = game values

How do we describe this variant's details, where slow means bid via 2N? "Slow denies / fast shows".

- fast 3N shows a stop
- slow 3N denies a stop
- fast cue shows a stop, GF, 4 card other major (staymanic after weak 2!d)
- slow cue denies a stop, GF, 4 card other major
- fast 3 level suit invitational (except the !c suit - downside of better minor)
- slow 3 level suit weak(er)

In the case of bidding !ss over a weak 2H, the weaker slow bid of 3!ss just shows 4 cards invitational instead of 5
cards invitational. With a weak !s hand there is room to just bid 2S.


* NT Ranges

** 2N as 20--21 hcp

*** Problem

Deciding whether to pass, bid game or even invite slam is harder opposite a 3 point opening range when starting the
bidding high up with 2N.

*** Solution

We play the 2N opening as 20--21 hcp.

There should be very little trouble with your 2C--2D--2N rebid being 22--23. Some players may agree that the 2N opening
includes a "bad" 22. A 24+ hcp hand should usually just try to make game.

** (experimental) 1N as 14--16 hcp

This changes all your balanced hand opening and rebid ranges. Why bother?

You can open 11 hcp balanced hands, which are very frequent. It's usually easier to bid if our side opens first and it
makes life harder for the opponents. As a bonus the 1NT opening is more frequent, so effectively more preemptive. The
1NT opening is still strong enough that going for a penalty is unlikely, especially if we were to only bid it non-vulnerable.

Whats the downside?

- we must remember the 2NT opening is now 19--20 hcp, which is usually fine, but now 2C--2D--2N is 21--22 (or bad 23) so we end up
  just going to game with a good 23+ hcp balanced. Again usually fine, but less precise
- a one level opening is already very wide ranging, we've just made it even wider, which makes judgement more difficult
  when the opponents compete to a high level
- our jump 2N bid (e.g. 1!d--1!s--2N) now shows 17--18 hcp (unless playing Gazilli), maybe only 17 hcp makes a 2N
  contract uncomfortable
- 1H--1N or 1S--1N is now even more wide ranging when playing a 2/1 game forcing system - is 12 hcp worth a game force
  or is it an invite opposite a potential 11 hcp balanced hand?
- similarly the 2/1 GF bids need slightly better hands as partner may only have 11 hcp balanced

You may rightly decide the problems outweigh the benefits. 14--16 hcp is a common range in artificial strong 1C systems
(Precision etc.), but the wide ranging openings of many (mostly) natural systems cause constructive bidding problems
when opening 11 hcp balanced. These aggressive balanced openings are more workable with [transfer Walsh](#Transfer Walsh Over 1C Opening)
and a 5--5--2--2 opening system (see the Junior Dutch Doubleton system), but it's certainly a lot of disruptive changes.

** 1H/1S 5--3--3--2 11 hcp Compromise

Moving everything to a 14--16 NT is a lot of work and not a free lunch, but we can still open more balanced 11 hcp
hands.

A 1HS bid with a reasonable suit and a hand that doesn't look like it needs downgrading can be opened. We get in the
bidding and suggest a lead. The extra length in your 5 card major will help towards setting up another trick.

The same argument could be extended to a 5 card minor suit, but a minor bid takes up less space (less preemptive) and
does not guarantee 5 cards. There is less lead direction to it.

* 1N and 3+ Level Responses

** Problem

Finding the best game when partner may have a 5 card major (giving us a possible 5--3 fit) or avoiding a bad 3N with a
major singleton.

Modern standard bidding will show a balanced NT hand if we have a 5 card major 5--3--3--2. Doing something else leads to
rebid problems. There are even other semi-balanced shapes that may bid NT if there's no good rebid, e.g. 4--5--2--2
without enough strength to reverse might open 1N (unless you play the Flannery 2!d convention, which we're not in our
base system and don't recommend).

If we have 3 cards in one or both majors and a weak doubleton, then it's helpful to check for a 5--3 fit before trying
3N. Common shapes such as 3--3 majors + 5--2 minors, 3--2 majors + 5--3 minors or 3--2 majors + 4--4 minors. Note with
4--3--3--3 it's often best to just bid NT with 3 or 4 cards in a major!

Sometimes we have a major singleton and 3 card other major which leaves 5--4 in the minors. If we had a 4 card major we
could use stayman then naturally bid our minor at the 3 level instead of a direct 3N. This would be done when we are
exploring 3N but have a weak singleton suit that needs stopping (after which we might play a 4--3 major fit or even 5!c!d).
However, without a 4 card major it's hard to bid these 3 card major hands safely.

** Solution

In our base system the 3 level responses to 1N are just natural, game forcing 6+ suits, with at least mild slam
interest. With slam going hands we can just start with normal transfers and then use the 3 level (and 4 level) responses
for something else.

So, here we introduce 3C as 5 card puppet stayman and 3HS as a way to show the awkward 3--1 major hands. That leaves one
bid that can show the 5--5 minors game force hand, which very rarely comes up.

The 5 card puppet stayman bidder may have one 4 card major, but never two (just bid normal 2!c Stayman!).

1N = natural NT, opening or overcall
  3C = 5 card puppet stayman
    3D = no 5 card major
      3H = 4!ss, paradox have other major
      3S = 4!hs, paradox have other major
      3N = to play
      4CD = 5 card slam try (usually start with minor transfer if 6 cards and 3 major)
    3H = 5!hs
      3N = to play
      4N = quantitative
      other = cue bid
    3S = 5!ss
      3N = to play
      4N = quantitative
      other = cue bid
  3D = 5--5+ minors game force
    3N = good major stops
    4CD = good support
    4N = artificial, pick a minor, usually 3--3
  3H = singleton, 3 card !s suit, 5--4 minors
    3S = 4 card major, offering a 4--3 fit
      3N = a singleton top honour
    3N = to play, stops
    4CD = natural, slam interest
    4N = pick a minor
    5CD = to play
  3S = singleton, 3 card !h suit, 5--4 minors
    3N = to play, stops
    4H = prefer 4--3 fit
    4N = pick a minor
    4CD = natural, slam interest
    5CD = to play

*** 4 Level Responses

It's not necessary to have meanings for 4 level responses. Normally we'd assume that 4HS is just to play and didn't want
to transfer. 4 level *Texas transfers* are commonly played though. These are used to transfer to a major at the 4 level.
Why do this?

These 4 level major transfer hands take up a lot of bidding space. This implies that there is very little if any slam
interest (so your other lower transfers are now more constructive if going to game). It can also be done to preempt the
opponent in 4th position out of the bidding - a weak long suit where even making game is uncertain.

There are two styles...

1N
  4D = !hs
    4H = transfer completion
  4H = !ss
    4S = transfer completion
  4S = natural, wants to declare

and

1N
  4C = !hs
    4D = excellent support, maximum, good controls
    4H = normal transfer completion
  4D = !ss
    4H = excellent support, maximum, good controls
    4S = normal transfer completion
  4HS = natural, wants to declare

The first one is more common and leaves room for the 4C bid to played as e.g the Gerber convention (not really
recommended). The second style gives extra space for opener to say if they have a really excellent hand with support
where a slam might be on.

When playing texas transfers with style one we have to remember that 4H is not natural, but 4S is natural (some may play
it as a slam try with 2--2 majors and 5--4 minors, but that seems forgettable and very rare). With the 2nd style 4HS
remains as natural wanting to play without transfering (e.g. protecting a Kx side suit holding).

**** 4S Serious Quantitative

If you don't have anything good use for your 4S bids, that is where it's not needed as a natural bid or cue/control bid
and we will remember the bids meaning then we can differentiate quantitative raises:

- 4S serious, looking for anything extra, e.g. 5 card suit and a minimum or good controls
- 4N normal quantitative, looking for extra points

Sometimes quantitative bids are made over bids that have 2 point ranges (e.g. 2N--4N where you agree to open 2N on
20--21 hcp). Regardless of point range, these bids are never strictly about hcp only, it's always about how many tricks
we will have at the end of the day. Long suits with working honours are often an extra trick, whilst 4--3--3--3 hands
even with maximum hcp can play poorly.

* 2-Over-1 Rebid Style

** Problem

Have we clarified how we bid after a 2/1 GF response? The base system includes jump new suits as splinters, 3N as 18--19
balanced and reverses as a good 14+ hcp. What is a 2M rebid or 2N and what is a new suit at the 3 level?

** Solution

You may already have a clear idea, but does your partner? In brief, there are two main styles, roughly strength showing
v.s. shape showing. These may be called Lawrence style and Bergen style.

Note, with either style we focus on finding the right game before slam bidding. The bidding system and continuations
after 2-over-1 is setup to prioritise finding these types of games in this order:

- 8+ card major fit
- 3N
- 7 card major fit (this can work well when we have enough top cards and when the short trump hand is likely to ruff)
- 5CD


With the shape showing Bergen style after a 1H/1S opening:

1M--2x = 2/1 response
  2M = 6+ card major
  2new = natural, shape showing
  2N = either balanced maybe no stop (minimum 12--14 OR maximum 18--19), OR poor 2nd suit not want to bid 3new
  3x = raise, good support, no extra strength required
  3new = natural, no extra strength required, but either 5 cards or reasonable 4 card suit
  3M = semi-solid+ suit, max 1 loser opposite a void, any strength

Shape style finds the 6 card major quickly making slam bidding easier, but checking for stops if ending in 3N is a
concern. Even with shape style some partnerships may restrict a new 3 level bid either to extras in hcp or extras in
shape (5 cards), in which case 2N can be more catchall. Note, a reverse does not promise any extras, it's just shape
showing.

With the Lawerence style 2M is catchall:

1M--2x = 2/1 response
  2M = 5+ card major, catchall
  2new = natural
  2N = balanced minimum, stoppers
  3x = raise with some extras, e.g. 14+ hcp
  3new = natural with some extras, e.g. either 5 cards or 14+ hcp
  3M = semi-solid+ suit, max 1 loser opposite a void, some extras
  3N = 18--19 balanced

This style is better at NT bidding, but untangling all the hands going through 2M can be difficult, making slam bidding
harder in particular.

The base system seems more aligned with the Lawrence style, but consider trying shape showing - when in a GF we can
work out strength later with conventions like Serious 3N and Last Train. There are conventional rebids such as the
"Schuler shift" (a 2N rebid is artificial showing a 6+ card major) that try to work around the problems with both these
approaches, but will add complexity and have other downsides.

*** Jump 3N Bids as 16--17 hcp

Any jump 3N by opener or responder in a 2/1 GF auction can be agreed to show ~16--17 hcp. For opener this is an
alternative to playing the jump rebid as 18--19 balanced. This is not fast arrival by responder!

It's rare we want to take up the space and risk missing some slam. Hands around the 16--17 hcp range are never quite
good enough for quantitative 4N bids but can often miss a slam if partner also has a similar point range. If opener has
18--19 balanced they can bid a slow 2N (i.e. could be 12--14 or 18--19) then raise quantitatively to 4N with the big
18--19 hand.


*** 1D--2C

This promises 5+ !cs and a game forcing hand.

Shape showing style for this:

1D--2C = 5+ !cs natural GF
  2D = 5+ !ds natural
  2HS = natural, 4+ card major, not 5+ !ds, no extra strength needed
  2N = 12--14 or 18--19 balanced, no 4 card major
  3C = natural, 3+ !cs
  3D = semi-solid+ suit, max 1 loser, 16+ hcp (not setting trumps as over 1M then 3M rebid)
  3HS = splinter, shortage and !c support, no extra strength needed

We rebid 2D first, up the line, where a long !d suit is held.

The 2HS rebids are usually balanced (unless 4--4--4--1). In our base system it would promise some extra strength, 14+,
but not here.

Whether you push 18--19 balanced through 2N to save space and go slow or bid 3N instead is up to you.

* 2-Over-1 Picture Raises and Picture Rebids

** Problem

Fast arrival bidding can remove all bidding space for exploring slams. Fast arrival is likely what players learn to use
by default when in a game forcing auction. Fast arrival means that bidding game quickly shows a minimum hand without
slam interest. Note in the 2-Over-1 GF context, definitely do NOT bid fast arrival with 2 keycards + Queen of trumps or
better, even with a minimum. Perhaps the first obvious place where we learn fast arrival is 2C--2D--2M--4M. We would go
slower and raise 2M to 3M with a better hand. It's possible to play fast arrival in other places, for example in
2-Over-1 GF auctions:

- 1S--2D--2S--4S
- 1S--2D--2H--4H
- 1H--2C--3C--4H
- 1H--2D--4H

Even with a minimum responder hand, slams can make when the two hands fit well. Opener can have some very strong hands
for their 1 level opening bids and jumping to game removes space for slam exploration.

** Solution

Picture raises are an alternative to fast arrival. Jump raising partner (their first or a possible second suit rebid)
shows more specific hand types. All of the above example auctions are treated as picture raises.

Jump bidding partner's suit after showing a side suit:

- shows trumps support and good side suit source of tricks
- 3 card trump support at least one top honour (Hxx) or with a 4 card support raise trump quality is less of a concern
- side suit quality, particularly with only 3 card trump support would be 3 top 5 or 2 top 3 honours

*** Picture Raise Jump level Determines Outside Controls

- Jumps below game shows some outside controls (outside of trumps or our side suit(s)) - 1S--2D--2H--3S
- Jumps to game show good trumps and side suit, but no outside controls, so some 5--4--2--2 shape (or by agreement
  5--4--3--1 with a shortage in partner's other suit)

*** Single Raises Ambiguous with Picture Bids

An auction like 1S--2C--2S--3S is more ambiguous as the only jump is to game, denying outside controls. Therefore the 3S
bid example could be a good hand with side suit and outside controls interested in slam, or it could just be waiting on
the way to game

*** With 3 Raises Available

Where there are 3 raises available, e.g:

1S--2D--2H
  2S = waiting, shape ask, 2 or 3 card support
    2N = 5--4--2--2 other suits
    3C = 3 or 4 cards, so !d shortage
    3D = 3 card support, so !c shortage
    3H = 5--5+
    3S = 6--4
  3S = outside controls
  4S = no outside controls

The shape ask has opener bid a quasi-natural 3 card suit or NT with 2--2 in the other suits. Stops irrelevant.

*** How to distinguish bad hands from slam going hands without fast arrival?

We already have a solution to this. Our base system does suggest using the Serious 3N convention in GF auctions where a
major is agreed/set:

- 1M--3M  (invitational in base system, but if accepting in a game force)
- 1M--2N--3x  (Jacoby 2N then shown extras)
- 1N--2D/2H--Transfer Break
- 1M--2x--2M--3M
- 1M--2x--2y--2M/3M

A 3N bid shows a serious slam try, whilst a direct 4 level control bid is more cooperative in case partner has a very
good hand. Either player can make use of this convention.

There is also the Last Train convention, a cuebid in the last suit before game without promising a control that
encourages slam. This may help where we didn't have the chance to use serious 3N.

*** Picture Rebids

Opener or responder can make picture rebids in a GF auction, that is jump rebidding their own suit or opener jump
raising responder. This still says something about outside controls:

- 1S--2H--4H, picture raise of responder, no outside controls, no shortage as not splintered
- 1S--2C--4C, minor picture raise of responder, jump below game promising an outside control
- 1S--2C--5C, minor picture raise of responder, jump to game, so no outside controls, extreme shape as bypassed 3N
- 1S--2C--3C, ambiguous, not a picture raise
- 1H--2D--4H, opener jump rebid, max 1 loser, no outside controls (otherwise just bid 3H)
- 1S--2C--3S, usual sets trump rebid, some outside control(s)
- 1H--2D--2H--4D, now responder has the max 1 loser suit, some outside control(s)
- 1S--2C--2D--5C, rare, responder has some extreme hand without outside controls, bypassed 3N

*** Beware the self-sufficient suit

If your suit is so good that it's likely to take all the tricks without any support then responder is better off showing
a shortage and support for opener.

*** 1D--2C GF

Picture raises can work here aswell, it's not only with majors:

1D--2C--2D = natural 5+!ds
  3D = ambiguous
  4D = picture raise, outside controls
  5D = picture raise, no outside controls, 5--5+ shapely hand as bypassed 3N

1D--2C--3D = natural 6+ !ds, max 1 loser suit, 16+ hcp
  3HS = mostly stop showing
  4D = !d slam try
  5D = picture raise, no outside controls, again shapely to bypass 3N

1D--2C--2M
  3M = natural, ambiguous raise
  4C = picture raise, outside controls
  4M = picture raise, no outside controls
  5C = picture raise, no outside controls, 5--5+ shapely hand as bypassed 3N

Note, there's no real need to waste space with 1D--2C--4D. A minor game rebid 1D--2C--5D is very rare as 3N maybe the
best auction even with 8 solid !ds and no outside control.


* 2-Over-1 Nebulous 2C Response

** Problem

The 1S--2H response already promises 5 cards, a good start to describing the hands. However, a minor response is not
very clear, both 2C and 2D could be bid on 3 cards, e.g. over 1S we may only have 4!hs (3--4--3--3). A 4 card minor suit
responder has also not shown much shape, just waited for opener to describe more, with hands over 1S such as 3--4--4--2
/ 3--4--2--4 / 2--3--4--4. Over 1H it is recommended to bid a game forcing minor instead of a 4 card !s suit, even with
a shorter minor (4--3--3--3) or same length minor (4--2--4--3 etc). We must do this to make it clear when we start an
auction with 1H--1S that it is a 5 card suit if we later game force (e.g. new suit at the 3 level, 3 level fourth suit
forcing). So, a minor could also be a short suit over 1H.

Note, it is possible to play a style of Jacoby 2N which includes 3 card GF support, but it's not common. It's even
possible to play 2N as GF balanced without support with some other jump suit bid as a Jacoby replacement. Balanced hands
are often better letting the unbalanced hand describe themselves and using that information to set the final contract.
Ideally this process of the unbalanced hand describing themselves starts as low as possible. Whilst 2N is not that high,
sometimes it also cuts out a little too much space, particularly because opener has such wide ranging hand strength and
they may have to take over the auction and captain things. In those situations it's clearer if a known 9 card fit
exists.

Some players have used 1M--3N as as 4--3--3--3 hand with 3 card support and ~13--15 hcp. This bid wastes too much space.
Even the most boring 13--15 hcp hand with 2 card major support can make slam bidding overly difficult by bidding a
natural 3N. It's worth playing [Two Tier Splinters](#Two Tier Splinters) instead or just not bidding 3N.


** Solution

1M-2C = either GF natural OR GF balanced with a 2+ card !c suit
1M--2D = natural GF, 5+ !ds

- Now 2D promises 5 cards, the same as 1S--2H. 2C sets a GF with any balanced hand whilst keeping the bidding low
- Note, this has nothing to do with 1D--2C auctions! Over 1D the 2C GF response also promises 5+ cards

Clearly the tradeoff is being unsure how many !cs responder has.

- When we only have 2!cs then we will certainly have 3 card major support, which can be shown with responder's next bid
- Responder will have 3+!cs if they do not have 3 card major support
- Splinter bids should be done with 5 card !c support, i.e. opener has a 5M + 5!c hand

When responder is given space, they can bid 2N to show a balanced hand. This is not always the case, so an optional
extra, instead of keeping the bidding purely natural, is to make 2D artificial:

1M--2C
  2D = either natural 4+ !ds OR 12--14 balanced (usually 5--3--3--2)
    2M = 3(+) card support
    2oM = artificial, 5+ !cs unbalanced with 4+ !ds, not worth 3C rebid, could be 6--4
    2N = balanced, natural
    3C = excellent 6+ card !c suit, max 1 loser
    3D = natural, unbalanced, 5--4+ minors
    3oM = natural 6!cs + 5oM extreme shape
  2M = 6+ cards, always Bergen style (we can handle both balanced hands with or without stops now)
  2oM = natural 4+ cards
  2N = 18--19 hcp balanced (usually 5--3--3--2)
  3C = natural 4+ !cs, 5--4+
  3D = splinter, 5+ !cs
  3oM = splinter, 5+ !cs
  3N = 18--19 balanced

An alternative way to distinguish the 2D and 2N bids is:

2D = either natural 4+ !ds OR 5--3--3--2 hand without stoppers
2N = (semi)balanced minimum, some stoppers in all suits

In some ways it's the same Bergen v.s Lawrence style issues. You might choose to bid 2D or 2N with a 5--4--2--2 minors
hand if you have values in the doubletons and little in a side 4 card !d suit.

The 2oM (other major) bid is also artificial as opener will not have a 4 card other major at that point and responder
would not have a 5 card other major without a 6--5 shape, with which they rebid 3oM.


* Constructive 2M Raises

** Problem

With the typical wide range for a 1H--2H or 1S--2S (e.g. 5--9 / 6--9 hcp) opener will often overstretch and invite game
then go off in a 3 level contract opposite some of those minimum raises.

** Solution

A 2M raise shows 8--10 support points. If also played with the recommended [mixed raises](#Mixed Raises with Jacoby Plus)
it usually shows exactly 3 card support, but only if you agree to bid 1N with 4 card support and 4--7 support
points. "Usually" 3 cards because you may not want to do a mixed raise with 4--3--3--3 and bid 2M instead.

Recall support/dummy points are usually add 1 for a doubleton, 3 for a singleton (5 for a void). Beware though, that
with only 3 card support when the opponents lead trumps you may struggle to get ruffs with dummy's short trump suit. So,
there are more reasons to consider downgrading any extra support points (e.g. don't overvalue multiple shortages).

3 card invites with 11--12 support points should already be bid via the semi-forcing 1N response. Hands with 3 card
support and 5--7 support points now must also go via 1N.

- 3 card 5--7 support points = 1N
- 3 card 8--10 support points = 2M
- 3 card 11-12 support points = 1N
- 4 card 5--7 support points = 1N
- 4 card 8--10 support points = mixed or 2M without mixed raises


* Mixed Raises with Jacoby Plus

** Problem

Separating 3 vs 4 card constructive raises that are a bit less than invitational in strength and trying to preempt any
4th hand bid.

** Solution

A mixed raise is a 4 card constructive raise, typically ~8--10 support points, so just below an invite, that is shown by
raising to the 3 level:

- 1C--3C
- 1D--3D
- 1H--3H
- 1S--3S

These bids make it much clearer when partner has a "good" 2 level raise (where we have a 9+ card trump fit). The extra
trumps often allow us to make a major game on (21)22/23 hcp. For a major raise or minor raise, it also preempts the 4th
hand from bidding. Note, some players choose to play a 3 level raise as a preempt, e.g. 0--6 hcp or similar, but these
bad hands often encourage the opponents to bid, whilst a more middling 8--10 support point type hand will often make
them keep quiet.

As these are constructive raises that usually imply some ruffing potential in a 9 card major fit, a very balanced
4--3--3--3 can be uncomfortable. Judgement required, especially if a 1M--2M raise is played as constructive.

Naturally, you will usually show a major in preference to jump bidding a minor and preempting yourself. After a minor
opening, you may consider if 3N will play well - partner's likely bid on 18--19 balanced. Partner wanting to bid with
18--19 balanced is another reason not to play an unclear 0--6 hcp or an even wider preempt. If the minor maybe short and
therefore can't be sure of a 9 card fit you won't be adding many points for shortages. Point count is roughly good 5 to
bad 10 hcp. A short minor opening (2+ cards) 3 level raise should have 6 card support.


** Extending Mixed Raises to Competition?

*** We Open They Overcall Situations and Reverting to Preemptive

For example, 1S--(2!d)--3S is often played as preemptive (worst than mixed) when the opponents are overcalling and
competing as we want to do everything to shut 4th hand out. So, mixed raises as 3M are not used in competition.

One below 3M, e.g. 3H in this example, can be artificial showing a mixed raise. UNLESS that would be the cue showing a
good raise. In those situations, 3M is just a normal mixed raise.

*** We Open They Takeout Double

Again one below 3M, 3M--1 can be the mixed raise. 3M continues to be preemptive as we normally play following a takeout double.

*** We Overcall and Jump Cue

Sometimes we overcall and advancer (overcaller's partner) may jump cue at the 3 level, below 3 of our suit. This is commonly a mixed raise.

For example, (1!d)--1S--(P)--3D

A 2D bid is our standard cue showing a good 10+ hcp raise, whilst 3D is mixed.


** Jacoby Plus for Standard Major Invites?

We now need a bid for our normal invitational hands. As we play 2 over 1 as game forcing, the other jump suit bids are
normally used for weak or intermediate jump shifts. We look at Jacoby plus here, though there is another option if you
find it easier.

*** 1M--3D alternative

Some players may prefer to use a 1HS--3D as an artificial 4+ card invitational raise of the major instead of using 2N
Jacoby plus. 1HS--3C and 1S--3H then remain as an invitational intermediate jump shift. 1S--3H is particularly useful to
keep as an invite as it is a major. Using the artificial 3D bid means that with invitational !ds you must start with 1N
and sometimes play in a 1N contract when 3D could have been better. If partner bids 2C over 1N (1M--1N--2!c) then you
can jump to 3D to show the invitational !d hand.

1M--3D = limit raise, 4+ card support
  3M = sign off
  4M = accept game invite
  3oM = (optional) shortage ask, slam try
  3N = (optional) showing other major shortage, slam try
  4CD = showing shortage, slam try

The 3N bid could also be the Serious 3N convention.

**** Giving up both 1M--3C/3D intermediate jump shift bids?

Note, if you give up the 3C bid aswell as 3D (and just bid 1N with both invite minor hands), then it is possible to play
a 1M--3M raise as preemptive and use the 1-under jump as the mixed raise. Over a 1S opening we can still show a !h
invite whilst having bid left over to show the general major limit raise.

As noted earlier, these bad hands often encourage the opponents to bid, so may not be a good idea. Preempting is more
important when the auction is live - the opponents are already overcalling/doubling.

*** Jacoby Plus

The 1H/1S--2N artificial Jacoby plus bid includes invitational hands which will affect the response structure. 2N is a 4+
card invite or game force. You may even choose to throw in some very good 3 card invites where it seems unpleasant
bidding 1N with a 3 card invite (e.g. extra shape or very good 11 hcp hand). Having more bids go through 2N can make the
slam bidding a bit harder. On the positive side, opponents are less likely to bid at the 3 level when responder may only
have an invitational hand.

How to respond to this 2N raise? There's many options to choose from below, a trade off between easy to learn and
effectiveness. Even if you play 1M--3D as the limit raise, there maybe some useful improvements to your Jacoby 2N
responses within these options worth considering.

*** Shortage Showing

Similar responses to standard Jacoby 2N. Ease of learning is the main advaantage here.

1M--2N
  3M = minimum, does not accept an invite
  3x = shortage, more than minimum
  3N = extras, nothing particular to show
  4x = decent 5 carder

It's unclear what 3N is here, it could be 18--19 balanced or 15 hcp and a boring 5--4--2--2 hand. That's where
conventions like "Last Train" may help, but this bid seems to take up too much space for effective slam exploration. The
shortage showing gives away information that responder may not care about.

*** Natural with Shortage Ask

1M--2N
  3CD = natural, extras
    next = shortage ask
  3M = minimum
  3oM = natural, extras
    next = shortage ask
  3N = natural, extras (balanced / semi-balanced or possibly terrible side suit)
  4x = void, extras

The easiest reasonably effective version? As the 4x bid is void showing, there's no easy way to separate a normal side
suit from a decent 5 card side suit, but at least 3N is clearer than the shortage showing option, though still unclear
about the major length. We could alter 4x to show a decent 5 carder. Gives away some shape info when opener has extras,
but hides the shortage unless asked for. The natural aspect allows for explicit double fit agreement and sometimes it's
better to play e.g. a 4--4 minor slam instead of the major.

*** 3C Artificial Minimum and Shortage Showing

1M--2N
  3C = artificial minimums
    3D = shortage ask
      3oM = shortage
      3M = no shortage
      4CD = shortage
  3D = extras, !d shortage
  3M = extras, no shortage
  3oM = extras, other major shortage
  3N = 18--19 balanced
  4C = extras, !c shortage
  4x = good 5 carder

Easy to learn and saves space when opener is minimum, but loses the 4!c bid to show a 5 carder. Still gives up shortage
info when opener has extras when responder may just want to go to game.

*** 3CD Artificial

This structure is more complex but gives more room to explore.

1M--2N
  3C = artificial, minimum hands, serious 3N will NOT apply
    3D = artificial shortage or control ask (you can reorder these responses if preferred)
      3oM = shortage
      3M = !c shortage
      3N = !d shortage
      4C = control, no shortage
      4D = control, no shortage, no !d control
      4H = (after 1!s opening) control, no shortage, no minor control
      4M = no shortage, no 1st or 2nd round side control
    3M = invite hands
      4M = something worth game raise
    3oM = shortage, too strong for splinter
    3N = !d shortage, too strong for splinter
    4C = !c shortage, too strong for splinter
    4M = to play
  3D = artificial, extras, no shortage, so balanced / semi-balanced
    3M = invite hands, forcing
    3oM = 1st or 2nd round control, 13+ hcp
    3N = serious, strong slam interest
    4CD = 1st or 2nd round control bid, cooperating on slam bidding (not serious), without other major control
    4H (after 1!s opening) strong splinter
    4M = opening hand, but denies side suit controls
    4N = keycard blackwood
    5x = exclusion keycard (if played)
  3H = artificial extras, !c shortage
    3S = (after 1!s opening) shows invitational hands
    3N = natural, multiple stops/values in shortage
    4x = control bidding
  3S = artificial extras, !d shortage
    3N = natural, multiple stops/values in shortage
    4x = control bidding
  3N = artificial extras, other major shortage
    4x = control bidding
  4x = good 5 card suit, extras
  4H = (after 1!s opening) good 5 card suit, 1st or 2nd round control in both minors

Apart from showing a good 5 card side suit with the 4x response, there's no easy way to find double fits - it's all
control bidding or shortage showing. Over the 3C minimum responder can show their own shortage, which is good for those
hands that are too strong to use two tier splinters.

*** Cohen Variation

Larry Cohen's approach was made without invitational raises in mind (orginally we respond 4M with the worst minimum
5--3--3--2 hands), but it should work without that, although you will be wondering whether to push on with 5--3--3--2
and 14 hcp.

1M--2N
  3C = minimum
    3D = artificial ask
      3H = artificial, some shortage
        3S = ask
          3N = other major shortage
          4CD = minor shortage
      3S = artificial, some 5--4--2--2
        3N = ask
          4CD = natural
          4M = other major side suit
      3N = 6--3--2--2 (or 7--2--2--2 in theory)
      4x = 5 card suit with an Ace or King, minimum values
      4M = worst 5--3--3--2
    3M = invitational hand
      4M = bit extra
    3oM = shortage, too strong for splinter
    3N = !d shortage, too strong for splinter
    4C = !c shortage, too strong for splinter
  3D = extras, some shortage
    3H = shortage ask
      3S = void
        3N = ask
          4CDH = !c/!d or other major voids
      3N = other major shortage
      4CD = minor shortage
  3H = extras, some 5--4--2--2
    3S = ask
      3N = other major side suit
      4CD = natural
  3S = extras, 6--3--2--2 or 7--2--2--2
  3N = extras, 5--3--3--2 (so 18--19 balanced)
  4x = good 5 card suit, extras

This is another variant that is particularly good at hiding information. May find double fits opposite 5--4--2--2 hands,
though we may want a minimum suit quality requirement to show such hands. Quickly shows 6+ card semi-balanced hands.

*** Wilson

      3N = 5--3--3--2 or bad 5--4--2--2 Q10xx or worse
      4C = !c control, 6+ card major, no shortage
      4D = !d control, 6+ card major, no shortage
      4H = (if !ss trumps) !h control, 6+ card major, no shortage
      4H = (if !hs trumps) 6 card major with no controls in other suits
      4S = (if !ss trumps) 6 card major with no controls in other suits

    3oM = splinter, too strong for immediate splinter
    3N = !d splinter
    4C = !c splinter
    4HS = to play
  3D = artificial extras (15+ hcp or less than 6 losers), balanced or semi-balanced 5/6/7 carder no shortage
    3H = ask
      3S = 5--4--2--2, 2nd suit QJxx or better
        3N = ask
          4CD = natural
          4H = other major

      4H = (if !hs trumps) 6 card major with no controls in other suits

    3S = artificial, a GF balanced raise
    3N = artificial, other major splinter
    4C = !c splinter
    4D = !d splinter
    4HS = to play
  3H = extras, 5 card major, some shortage

          4M = !c
      4C = !c singleton
      4D = !d singleton
      4H = other major singleton
    3N = balanced limit raise
    4CD = splinter, too strong for immediate splinter
    4H = other major splinter, too strong for immediate splinter
  3S = extras, 6+ card major, some singleton
    3N = ask
      4CD = shortage
      4H = other major shortage

      4M = !c
      4oM = other major void
  4CD = extras, decent 5 card side suit
  4H = extras, decent 5 card other major side suit

Has some facility to find double fits if opener is 5--4--2--2, otherwise mainly shortage focussed but with the advantage
of quickly showing openers major length when they have extras. Still has an immediate 4x bid to show a 5 card side suit.

*** Interference Handling

Usually at the 3 level.

1M--2N--(3x)
  P = no control
  X = penalty
  3N = serious, has control of their suit Kx or an Ace
  other = control, has control of their suit Kx or an Ace
  4M = minimum with control



* Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT

** Problem

Bidding a variety of hand shapes and hand strengths after a 1N rebid (1x--1y--1N).

4 strengths to consider:

- sign off / weak / part-score hand
- invitational and wanting to keep the invites as low as possible (unsure of major fit)
- game forcing and unsure what game to play (NT, minor fit with poor stops somewhere, 5--3 major fit etc.)
- game forcing with slam interest (do the hands work well together for 12 tricks?)

Some hand varieties:

- With support for openers suit (often a minor that is sometimes safer than 3N)
- With our own long suit 6+ (usually want to play in a 6+ major)
- With two suited hands (single or double fit possible, is NT safe?)
- With a 5 card suit that needs 3 card support

** Terminology and Solution

For reference, new minor forcing (NMF) is responder's bid of an unbid minor after opener rebids 1NT. As ever, there is
more than one variation of NMF. NMF is by common consensus strictly worse than the Checkback Stayman convention that we
already play in our base system.

Two-Way NMF is also known as "xyNT" as it is on in any auction starting 1x--1y--1N (two one level suit bids then a 1NT rebid).
The "Two-Way" is because we have 2 conventional bids after the 1N rebid:

- 2C artificial relay, for showing invitational hands or weak !ds
- 2D artificial, for game forcing hands that want to ask opener for more information

There is also the "XYZ" convention, which might be considered another version of Two-Way NMF. That can be used after any
three 1 level bids such as 1C--1H--1S. In our base system style this example auction would show an unbalanced hand and
1N maybe rebid with 4!ss to show the balanced hand and limit the strength to 12--14 straight away. Other partnerships
may prefer to show the !ss immediately as a 4--4 fit can be missed when responder is weak. Note, the Walsh bidding style
over 1C/1D is to show a shorter major instead of a minor at the 1 level if not GF strength, which makes missing
fits less likely. We focus on the easier to remember xyNT here.

1x--1y--1N
  2C = relay to 2!d, all invite or choice of game hands (except possible 4--4 majors invite), or weak !ds
    2D = relayed
      P = !d sign off, weak
      2y = 5 card invite
        P = 2 or 3 card support, prefer trump contract
        2N = maximum, no fit
          3m = distributional minor side suit
      2N = invite
      3new = 5--5 invite
      3y = 6 card invite
      3N = choice of games (5--3--3--2 with a major)
    2HS = (advanced) good !ds, maximum, 3 card major support or 4 card new major
  2D = game forcing, Checkback (next show 3 card major support or a new 4 card major)
    2M = agree if bidding 3 card support before 4 card other major or just lowest bid first
    2N = no 3 card major support, no 4 card other major
    3CD = (optional) show good 5 card minor
  2H = weak, natural
  2S = (after 1!s response) to play
  2S = (after 1!h response) 4--4 majors invite
  2N = relay to 3C
    3C = bid as asked
      P = !c signoff
      3D = artificial, 5 card major, 4 card minor support for opener, low other suit shortage
      3H = artificial, 5 card major, 4 card minor support for opener, high other suit shortage
      3S = artificial, 4 card major, 5 card minor support for opener, low other suit shortage
      3N = artificial, 4 card major, 5 card minor support for opener, high other suit shortage
  3CDHS = natural slam try (5--5 two suiter, 6+ single suiter)
  3N = to play

** Downsides?

Apart from generally forgetting that 2C and 2D are artificial, forgetting that 2N is not natural is the most common
mistake.

To start with you could choose not to play the advanced responses over the 2N artificial bid, just play it as a !c sign
off.

We still have to go to the 3 level to sign off in !cs, but Checkback or NMF may not have any !c sign off.


* 1NT Responses, Smolen and Others

** Problem

Some hand types are hard to show, such as invitational 5--5 hands. Invitational hands with a 5 card !s suit (and !h
suit) often bid too high opposite a misfitting opener. 5--4 major hands may find a fit but don't always let the stronger
hand (opener) declare when the second suit is agreed. Some hands struggle to show a game going 5 card major suit and
avoid a bad 3N or even bad 4HS contract.

There are many systems of 1NT responses. Some improvements can be made without too much effort.

** Smolen after Stayman 2C--2D

A jump 3HS bid after the negative stayman response has no meaning in our base system. Here it's used to check for a
major fit with a 5--4 majors GF hand and transfer the play to opener. Playing Smolen will free up the transfer then
other major bid.

2C = stayman
  2D = no major
    3HS = GF 5--4 majors, shows the four card major!
      3N = no fit
      4HS = fit with the 5 card suit, declares

What to do with the transfer bids...

*** 1N--2D--2H--2S

Instead of being GF you might choose to play it as invitational with 5!hs + 4!ss, or just both majors 5--5 invitational.

Some more complicated structures involving transfers after transfers, may decide to play the 2S bid as any invitational
hand with 5!hs so that the 2N bid is a transfer to !cs.

*** 1N--2H--2S--3H

Depending on what is done with the other transfer this could be 5--5 invitational or a 5--5 GF hand.

** Splinters and 5 card Check after Stayman 2C--2H/2S

The bids 1N--2C--2H--3S and 1N--2C--2S--3H already agree the major and start a slam try in our base system. As we often open 5
card majors it can help to check for that extra source of tricks. Additionally some unused bids can be splinters.

1N--2C--2H
  3S = agree !hs, slam try, checks !h length
      3N = 4 card !h suit
      4CD = cue bid, 5!hs
      4H = 5!hs, minimum
  4CDH = splinter, singleton/void with !s support

1N--2C--2S
  3H = agree !ss, slam try, checks !s length
      3S = 4 good !ss, some weak suit often !hs
      3N = normal bid with 4!ss
      4CDH = cue bid, 5!ss
      4S = 5!ss, not good for slam
  4CDH = splinter, singleton/void with !s support

Note, you need something more complicated to specifically show a !s shortage below game after agreeing !hs.

** Invitational 5 carder 2S Bid after Stayman Instead of Transfer then 2N

This is independent of Smolen. Some may play this bid as 5--5 invite or just have no agreement. When learning transfers
we are taught to transfer then bid 2N with a 5!ss and an invite. These hands often play better in 2S than 2N even with
a 7 card fit.

2C = stayman
  2DH = negative or !hs
    2H = weak majors
    2S = invitational, might have 4!hs
      P = min/medium no fit
      2N = max no fit (aggresive raises may pass without a fit)
      3S = medium hand
      4S = max

The downside here is that with a weak majors hand you always have to bid 2H, possibly some 4!h 5!s hands

Note, you can choose a different style over 2S and have opener bid 2N without a fit. This then allows for responder to
bid another suit to show any type of 5--5 invitational hand with 5!ss. These are quite rare, and often invitational
hands can just bid game and hope. It's more common for 2S to be a better place to play than 2N even with the 7 card fit.
When you know partner will not put you in 2N with a minimum the invites can be more aggressive, finding more tight
games.

Nothing here helps with 5!h 4!s invite hands as long as 2H shows weak majors ("garbage stayman"). You cannot use 2H for
all 5!h invitational hands as partner may respond 2S to Stayman.


** (advanced) Transfers After Transfers

For the curious, here's some of the things you can do with transfers after transfers. It has ways to avoid a bad 3N
contract by showing singletons, or working out whether to play 3N or 4HS with an 8 card major fit.

This structure assumes you play 2S after Stayman as invitational with 5!ss and also use Smolen with GF 5--4 majors
hands.

2D = transfer to !h, 5+ cards
    2H = normal bid
        2S = artificial, 5!hs invitational
            2N = deny

* 2N Responses

** Problem

We've opened 2N. It does describe our hand quite well and stops the opponents easily bidding. However, the auction is
so high already that finding the right game or slam hunting is difficult.

Designing responses over 2N is difficult. Opening 2N is often a slam killer given the lack of space left.  There's so
many response structures over 2N, all with different flaws. Given the prevalence of opening 2N with a 5 card major,
committed partnerships often want to play some sort of modified puppet (muppet) 5 card stayman, but it's much easier
just to play 4 card Stayman and Smolen (which maybe fine at IMPs where the +20 from a 5--3 major fit matters little). 2N
+ muppet responses become very complex as you try to to support every type of responding hand and at the same time
minimise information leakage. Even a basic muppet system has a lot of bids that have responder bid the other major or
relay/retransfer somehow to make opener play the contract.

** Solution

The minimum recommendation is simlar to [over 1N](#1NT Responses, Smolen and Others) / [over 1N higher responses](#1N and 3+ Level Responses).

- 4 card Stayman
- Smolen
- 3S as minors or !c single suiter slam try
- 4C as !d single suiter slam try
- 4D/4H Texas transfers

Given the lack of space to be scientific transfer breaks are informative/revealing showing a side source of
tricks and possibly done on 3 cards (with good controls, some doubleton and HHx 2/3 top honours support).

As we are playing Smolen, we do not need the immediate 2N--3S response to show 5!ss + 4!hss. Now we have a way to show
the minors (or !cs which we did before by bidding 4C naturally). This bit in particular adds some complexity and it is
rare.

Slam tries in a major start with a 3 level transfer. Any weaker hands should Texas transfer immediately because a 3
level transfer then 4H/4S implies mild slam interest.

As 4C Gerber is not a great convention we use it show a !d slam try.

*** 2N--3C Stayman

Mostly standard, but given the lack of space we use dedicated bids for 4--4 majors and include some 5--5 major
hands (strong slam try or just to play game).

3D = no major
  3H = Smolen OR 5--5 majors best slam try
    3N = to play, usually 2!ss + 3!hs
      4H = 5--5 strong slam try
  3S = Smolen
  4H = 5--5 majors, to play a game
3H = 4/5!hs, not !ss
3S = 4/5!ss, not !hs
3N = 4--4 majors, minimum would not accept slam invite
  4DH = transfer to a major
4C = 4--4 majors, max
  4DH = transfer to a major

*** 2N--3D Transfer

Again, mostly familiar, but as we have Smolen for 5--4 major GF+ hands, transferring then bidding 3S can be played as
puppet bid to force 3N and then show more hand types. We're too high to use it as an invite.

3H = normal transfer completion
  3S = puppet
    3N = forced
      4CD = natural, mild slam try
      4H = 5--5 majors mild slam try (we use stayman with a strong slam try)
  3N = choice of game, 5 card major
  4CD = natural, good slam try
  4H = natural (implies very mild slam interest if playing but not using Texas transfers)
  4S = (advanced) could play as exclusion keycard blackwood or 0--5--4--4 shape slam try
  5CD = exclusion keycard blackwood
others = transfer break, whatever style you like, e.g. show source of tricks

*** 2N--3H Transfer

Here, the 4H continuation is very rare, but we have 5--5 major hands covered by other initial responses.

3S = normal transfer completion
  3N = choice of game
  4CD = natural slam try
  4H = (advanced) could play as exclusion keycard blackwood or 5--0--4--4 shape slam try
  5CDH = exclusion keycard blackwood
others = transfer break, whatever style you like, e.g. show source of tricks


*** 2N--3S

As !cs is the potential single suiter we focus on !c length and go from there. There are more complicated versions that
can show the major shortage with both minors, but these auctions are rare.

In the interests of space saving, after agreeing a minor then one above the minor suit is recommended to ask for
keycards instead of 4N (known as Redwood), but you can keep playing 4N as keycard blackwood. Notice why it's hard to bid
slams after opening 2N - often we struggle to show 2 suits and also set the trumps for a slam try. 4N bids are often
needed as natural before any suit is agreed.

3N = less than 4!cs
    4C = 5--4+ minors
        4D = 4+ !ds, reasonable controls
            4H = !d keycard blackwood
        4HS = 3--3 minors, control bid, reasonable controls (showing a 5 card major is pointless)
            next = keycard blackwood, ideally two suit keycard (or play as 4N bid)
            5CD = to play
        4N = to play
        5D = 4+ card support, poor controls (e.g. max 6 CP with 20hcp NT)
    4D = !c keycard, 6+ !cs
    4H = !d keycard, rare 6+ !ds and !cs (i.e 6--5 minors, possibly 6--4)
4C = 4+ !cs, good controls
    4D = !c keycard

*** 2N--4C

!d single suited slam try.

As it's a slam try it's not meant as a transfer sign off, but could try to sign off in 4D expecting to go to 5D if
opener has some support.

4D = reject
    4H = !d keycard blackwood
    4N = to play
others = optional RKB

We introduce yet another interesting way to slam bid when left without much room to agree a suit. We want opener to be
the one showing keycards with responder in control. Therefore, if we like !ds we use "optional" keycard blackwood where
the first bid is a negative rejecting the slam try and any other bid is like responding to keycard blackwood. In this
example, 4H shows 1/4 keycards, 4S shows 3/0 keycards etc.


*** (advanced) A Muppet System?

Comparing 5 card muppet stayman systems won't be covered in depth here. However, a note about 3 level transfers.
Regardless if playing 5 card Stayman or not, some (e.g. European) standards might only accept a transfer to 3H/3S with 3
cards. This means you would pass with a really bad major or Texas transfer to 4H/4S - you cannot reliably sign off at
the 3 level. If trying to find all 5--3 major fits it can actually help to transfer to your own five card major and have
opener break to show 5 cards in the remaining major and 2 in your transfer suit (but still transfering with 2 in your
transfer suit and less than 5 in the other major, unlike some European standards). With this approach you should be able
to find any 5--3 major fit with opener using transfers or Muppet Stayman without making some other bidding sequences
difficult or impossible to sort out. You cannot sign off in 3H/3S though.

If you want a very complex effective set of responses, maybe research Matt Nilsland's Scanian 2N responses. There's
plenty of online information about basic Muppet responses and many that get increasingly complicated. For the curious,
the outline of one approach is below. It tries to keep as many natural 4CD slam try bids as possible, to not be too
complex relative to most Muppet systems. Every detail is left in, but you don't have to have such specific agreements
on what the bids mean further on in the auction.

* Two Tier Splinters

** Problem

Our splinter bid responses to an opening 1H or 1S bid are ~9--12 hcp (12--15 support points considering the singleton).
The range is quite small because the bid takes up a lot of bidding space. What to do with more values?

When we have a decent 5 card suit we may look for a double fit and bid a new suit, but if we have a typical splinter
hand (spread out values and a singleton) we will have to bid 2N Jacoby. Standard Jacoby responses maybe good at letting
opener show a shortage, but responder can struggle to show a splinter sort of hand, perhaps only able to show generic
controls when slam hunting. It's very helpful to show a splinter hand - in the ideal situation partner may have zero
points and a few small cards in your splinter suit that can be ruffed in your hand. In that situation 10 hcp from the
deck are irrelevant to the slam after you have lost that one singleton (sometimes void and no losers).

** Solution

Two tier splinters gives us two strength ranges for splintering opposite a major opening.

- 1H--3S, 1S--3N shows a splinter in some *unknown* suit with the lower tier strength ~(9)10--12 hcp
- direct splinters show an upper tier of strength ~13--15 hcp
- 16+ hcp splinter hands still need to start with Jacoby 2N, but with their extra strength it's safer to push slam
  afterwards without being sure how well partner's hand fits opposite the typical splinter shape

1H
  3S = some 10--12 hcp splinter
    3N = ask, next step
      4CD = shortage
      4H = !s, shortage
    4H = to play, no slam interest, opponents do not know the singeton
  3N = !s shortage, 13--15 hcp
  4C = !c shortage, 13--15 hcp
  4D = !d shortage, 13--15 hcp

1S
  3N = some 10--12 hcp splinter
    4C = ask, next step
      4DH = shortage
      4S = !c, shortage
    4S = to play, no slam interest, opponents do not know the singeton
  4C = !c shortage, 13--15 hcp
  4D = !d shortage, 13--15 hcp
  4H = !h shortage, 13--15 hcp

Over the lower tier unknown splinter you can play the asking bid in different ways, such as low/middle/high suit instead of
trying to match to suits "naturally".

Any downsides to two tier splinters? Only that the responses are not as easy to remember as "a double jump is a
splinter". Some players have used 1HS--3N as 4--3--3--3 with 3 card support, choice of game with 13--15 hcp, but this
wastes a lot of bidding space if opener has a potential slam hand. We now have to remember that 1HS--3N is always
artificial!

** (optional) mixing in 16/17+ hcp splinters

Instead of pushing the very strong splinters via Jacoby 2N where we are unlikely to see if responder has a splinter type
hand (actually depends on your Jacoby 2N response structure) it's possible to make the lower tier unknown splinter in an
unknown splinter with 10--12 hcp or a 16/17+ hcp hand (the direct splinter may want to be 13--16 hcp now).

With this change the strong splinter hand is supposed to be comfortable bidding on with 4N keycard blackwood after
opener signs off with 4S, or a 4S cue bid after a 4H sign off. Particularly with !ss as trumps opener is just responding
to RKB so they cannot really bid cooperatively. Therefore there maybe little point in this compared to using Jacoby 2N
unless responder is going to cue bid instead of bid 4N, but even then opener may not be sure of the shortage suit - if
we bid 5D is that the shortage suit or is it just denying a !c control? Might be better if there was a special agreement
that such cue bids are very specific, such as showing a void and asking for exclusion keycard responses.

* 1C/1D--2N GF

** Problem

Opener often has a mundane minimum balanced hand when opening a minor suit. Checking stops before going to 3N can be
difficult, particularly when we try to show one or two major suits before getting to game, i.e auctions that start
1C/1D--1M--1N. Conventions such as Checkback or Two Way New Minor Forcing focus on shape more than stops. When we don't
have any major to show and have minor support the inverted minor raise gives us the chance to check for stops, but other
sequences are less helpful for stop checking.

On top of that, it's not just having a stop but having the right hand play the contract. A suit like AQx works more like
a double stop if the lead comes round to that suit, which means we want that hand to declare the contract.

** Solution

Play 2N over 1C/1D as game forcing AND allow it to contain a 4 card major. If you want to declare start with 2N, but if
you think it better for partner to declare then try something else.

As it is game forcing, we can have a mix of balanced strengths to make slam bidding easier.

The stronger 18--19 response hands can safely raise 3N to 4N quantitatively later on. Temporizing with another bid then
bidding 3N could then show 16--17 hcp, which is a most awkward point range to decide on whether to slam invite. However,
if you want to keep it simpler to start, then 2N could just be a GF and less specific about hcp.

1C--2N = GF, 12--15 or 18--19, maybe 4 card major
  3C = Stayman (not with 4--3--3--3)
  3D = artificial !c suit rebid, 6+ !cs
  3HS = shortage, 5--4+ minors

1D--2N = GF, 12--15 or 18--19, maybe 4 card major
  3C = Stayman (not with 4--3--3--3)
  3D = natural !d suit rebid, 6+ !ds
  3HS = shortage, 5--4+ minors

*** Invitational NT hands?

- over 1C we might bid 1D with only 3 cards (needs alerting) and no 4 card major and bid 2N later
- inverted minor raise if we have support
- bid a 4 card major if we have one before bidding 2N
- just bid 1N on a close invite, e.g. 11 hcp else optimistically try game

Over 1D there's the artificial option of 1D--2H showing 11--12 balanced without a 4 card major (if you can remember it),
but you may prefer to keep the weak jump shift bid. Note you could also be playing 1D--2H as Reverse Flannery.


* Transfers after 1M--(X) or 1M overcall--(X)

** Problem

The opposition do a takeout double of our opening or negative/takeout double of our 1H/1S overcall. How can we show a
weak hand with a good suit before 4th hand bids? How can we accurately show support before 4th hand bids?

** Solution

Part of the solution is to look at the other section on [mixed raises](#Mixed Raises with Jacoby Plus) where we suggest
playing a 3M raise as preemptive and a jump cue bid or the one below 3M bid as a mixed raise when the opponents do a
takeout double. That covers a lot of 4 card support hands.

For worse 3 card support hands we can divide the 2 level bid into different strengths with transfers:

1S--(X) = takeout
  2H = transfers into !ss, good 2 level raise, ~8--10 support points
  2S = bad 2 level raise, e.g. ~4--7 support points
  2N = good invite plus hands
  3H = 1-under jump, mixed raise ~7--9 hcp, 4 card support
  3S = preemptive

Normally a new suit is constructive ~9+ hcp, but with transfers we can show hands similar to a weak two, something lead
directing with support, or just a normal constructive 5+ card suit that will bid again.

1S--(X) = takeout
  1N = !cs, 6+ hcp, sound weak two or better 6+ cards OR 5 cards and will bid again, or lead directing 4+ suit with 3 card support
  2C = !ds, 6+ hcp ...
  2D = !hs, 6+ hcp ...

That's it. The downside is that you lose a natural 1N bid, but that's rarely useful in these types of auctions.
Redoubles are still likely to show a hand with 10+ hcp, possible penalty interest. It's possible to play XX as doubleton
support and 6+ hcp, which is in many ways similar to a 1N bid, but then what to do with singleton support for partner
and good values?

Note, when they have bid a suit a transfer into their suit is like a cue bid showing good support.

(1D)--1S--(X) = negative
  1N = !cs
  2C = cue bid, transfer into their suit
  2D = !hs, 6+ hcp (even though responder implied !hs with their negative double!)
  2H = transfers into !ss, good 2 level raise, ~8--10 support points
  2S = bad 2 level raise, e.g. ~4--7 support points

* Transfers after Preempt--(X)

** Problem

We open a preempt (weak two usually, or by agreement a weak three) and the opponents double. How can we escape to
another suit? How can we constructively bid another suit before something else? How can we show a normal competitive
raise or constructive mild invite?

** Solution

As doubles are penalty after we open a preempt, if the opponents double our preempt we do not really need XX to show
penalty interest. Therefore, we can use XX as part of a transfer mechanism.

2S--(X)
  XX = !c transfer
  3C = !d transfer
  3D = !h transfer
  3H = !s invite
  3S = competitive raise

Note, you shouldn't break the transfer - it might be a very bad hand. Transfers could be escaping, descriptive choice of
game, or showing a side suit with some support for opener. The quick invite bid is clearer than using the normal 2N
asking bid, especially if the 4th hand bids.

An alternative structure is to keep XX as penalty interest - maybe easier to remember and lets opener cooperate in the
penalty search immediately.

2S--(X)
  XX = values/penalty
  2N = !c transfer
  3C = !d transfer
  3D = !h transfer
  3H = !s invite
  3S = competitive raise

which over 2H looks like...

2H--(X)
  XX = values/penalty
  2S = NF
  2N = !c transfer
  3C = !d transfer
  3D = !h transfer
  3H = !s invite
  3S = competitive raise

A 3rd option is to use XX as asking partner to respond to the 2N asking bid system (pretend we bid 2N as the usual ask)
with a direct 2N bid being a !c transfer. This just flips the XX and 2N from the 1st solution.

2S--(X)
  XX = 2N system on
  2N = !c transfer
  3C = !d transfer
  3D = !h transfer
  3H = !s invite
  3S = competitive raise


You must discuss if you want to play transfers over a weak three then double. Some may play it over 3HS only, however,
it's too late to differentiate invitational vs competitive raises and trying to escape seems odd given the length of
their suit. You can still agree to lead direct with implicit support when bidding new suits, e.g:

3H--(X)
  XX = values/penalty
  3S = fit non-jump lead directing implication
  3N = to play
  4CD = fit non-jump lead directing implication
  4H = to play, strength unclear


* 1M--(1N) then 2CD Major Bids

** Problem

The opposition do a 1N overcall of our 1H/1S opening. How can we distinguish a constructive 2 level raise from a
competitive 2 level raise? What about showing a potential double major fit?

** Solution

We trade off and lose a natural 2C/2D bid. Arguably not the most useful bids as advancer may then have the other major
to compete over it. The 2C/2D bidder would be on lead against 1N so there is less lead directing value.

1H--(1N)
  X = penalty/values
  2C = ~8--10 support points, good !h raise, worse than mixed raise
  2D = competitive, 5--3 !ss + !hs typically, maybe aggressive 5--2 with Hx
  2H = natural, ~4--7
  2S = natural, NF competitive
  3C = preempt (no natural minor bid available at lower level)
  3D = 1-under jump, mixed raise ~7--9 hcp, 4 card support (if playing mixed raises)
  3H = preemptive

1S--(1N)
    X = penalty/values
    2C = ~8--10 support points, 3 cards, good !s raise, worse than mixed raise
    2D = competitive, 5--3 !hs + !ss typically, maybe 5--2 with Hx
    2H = natural, NF competitive
    2S = natural, ~4--7, 3 cards
    2N = [invitational plus support](#HCR cue bids and 2N Raise in Competition), 2N system on
    3CD = preempt
    3H = 1-under jump, mixed raise ~7--9 hcp, 4 card support (if playing mixed raises)
    3S = preemptive


* Support Doubles and Redoubles

** Problem

How to show 3 v.s. 4 card support for responder's major when the opponents compete.

1D--(P)--1S--(2C)

We do not know if partner has 4 or 5+ !ss. We want to estabilish if we have a fit before the opponents interfere
further. Knowing 3 v.s. 4 card support helps us judge how high to compete (Law of Total Tricks etc.).

** Solution

Support doubles and redoubles are made by opener (no one else but opener) and show exactly 3 card support for
responder's 1 level bid major suit.

Forgetting to use them or alert them is problematic, so make sure both partners are comfortable with them!

Open--(pass/X/bid)--1HS--(bid)

- notice that *responder* makes a 1 level bid
- it doesn't mean that the 4th hand overcalling has to be at the one level, just responder
- if responder has bid at the 2 level then play double or redouble as penalty interest, e.g. 1H--(P)--2D--(X)--XX
- responder bids a major (some players by advanced agreement may also decide to use it to show !d support)
- how high in the bidding to play these is up to partnership agreement
- NOT if the opponent bidding over responder bids a *natural* 1NT, e.g. 1D--(P)--1S--(1N)--X, then double is penalty
- NOT for overcaller / advancer

*** Double and Redouble of 1 Level Overcaller

1D--(P)--1H--(1!s)--X

Opener shows 3 card !h support. Nothing about strength at this level - could be minimum or a game force. Raises of !hs
would show 4+ card support.

1D--(P)--1H--(X)--XX

Same but using a redouble to show 3 !hs.

*** When Overcaller is How High?

**** Below 2 of Responders Suit

This is the standard agreement, e.g:

1C--(X)--1S--(2!h)--X

Responder is still bidding at the 1 level as required by this convention but now overcaller is at the 2 level, below
2 of responders suit which would be 2!s.

Opener shows 3 card !s support. Again nothing much about strength, but perhaps you wouldn't double with the worst
balanced minimum 12 hcp hand.

**** Optional: Even Higher with Extra Values

Discuss how high you will play support doubles and redoubles if going beyond 2 of responder's suit.

1D--(P)--1H--(2!s)--X

Opener shows 3 card !h support with something extra, e.g. 15+ hcp or extra distribution (so not balanced 12--14 hcp).

1D--(P)--1S--(3!h)--X

This high?

1D--(P)--1S--(4!h)--X

Possibly this high, no higher

*** Do we have to show support?

Can we ignore the 3 card support sometimes, even if we have the values to show support?

In short, we do not have to show support, there maybe far more important things to say about your hand, e.g:

- we have our own excellent suit that is far more likely to be played in
- our hand is very defensive, too many values in the opponents suits
- our hand is very balanced and minimum, e.g. 4--3--3--3
- our hand is very balanced with a double stopper so worth playing NT

* Reverse Continuations

** Problem

After a reverse rebid (showing a 2nd suit at the 2 level that is higher ranked than our first suit) we have shown a hand
that's worth roughly 17+ hcp (distribution and concentration of values depending) with the second suit always being
shorter than the first suit (we always open the higher of two equal length suits). Partner's initial response does not
promise enough values for game as they may only have 4--6(7) hcp opposite ~17 hcp. So, reverse rebids do not create a GF
(in contrast a jump shift rebid does create a GF). Auctions can be awkward as we try to sort out part score vs game vs
slam try hands.

Our base system uses the Blackout 2N convention (2N relays to 3C, but can be broken by a 19/20+ hcp hand) after a
reverse to show all weak options. Any other bid except 2N for responder's rebid is constructive, GF:

- responder rebidding their own suit is constructive, 5+ cards. Note, as we are playing weak jump shift responses over
  opener's bids we are unlikely to have a 6 card major and a weak hand
- responder's jump rebid sets their own suit (a max 1 loser suit)
- raising is game forcing, if it's a major raise the Serious 3N convention is on
- the familiar FSF convention is available
- preference to opener's first suit agrees that suit, though 3N may be chosen

Blackout is fairly mechanical and so easy to understand. Lebensohl in this situation is basically the same, another 2N
bid to show a weaker hand. The problem with Blackout or similar is that it's hard to find some part scores, e.g. how do
we find a 5--3 major fit (assuming responder has a weak hand with a 5 card major) without potentially bypassing the best
contract. Sometimes 2N is actually the best partscore. Even when opener has the values to GF (~19/20+ hcp) then the 3N
contract is often wrong-sided by responder using 2N for weaker hands. A rarer concern could be slam hunting when
responder has a 5--5, then FSF for responder's rebid gets in the way.

Note, a very natural approach to bidding over a reverse will find part scores easily - simple raising partner's first or
second suit, bidding 2N or rebidding 2M can all be NF. Without any conventional bid we now have a different problem -
it's harder to set a GF and investigate slam. How to show our own strong trump suit and look for slam or make a forcing
raise of partner's suit? Stop checking is available if you still play FSF (some play natural here). Overall the natural
limit bidding approach is fine if missing slams is not a concern.

** Solution

After a 1x--1y--2z reverse auction (we're ignoring 1N responses for the moment) responder's rebids include:

- supporting partner's first or second suit is GF (the same as with Blackout)
- responder's 2M rebid is shape showing 5+ cards - weak OR GF
- the LOWER bid of EITHER the 4th suit OR 2N is a weak braking bid
- where the 4th suit is not the weak braking bid, the 4th suit is natural showing a GF 5--5 hand

Note, bidding will be as ECONOMICAL / space saving as possible! What responder bypasses / skips in their rebid they deny
having.

- Responder skipping past 2M to bid the lower of the 4th suit or 2N denies a 5 card major
- The other way around, skipping the weak braking bid if it's lower than 2M shows a GF hand
- bidding 2N if the 4th suit is lower, is simply a GF waiting bid (no support for partner's suits, no 5 card major),
  maybe no stop as FSF is not available for responder's immediate rebid

Later, after responder's rebid the bidding is natural and FSF is back on.

*** After 1N Response - 3rd Suit Weak Braking

After a 1x--1N--2y reverse there is no 4th suit so this time we use the cheaper 3rd suit or 2N as the weak braking bid.

*** 1H--1N--2S Exception

- 2N is responder's catchall GF bid
- 3x is NF


* Jump Reverses

What does an auction like 1C--1S--3H actually mean? Consider the following:

- 1D--1H--1S is non forcing, ~11--17(18) hcp. Our base system would describe this as an unbalanced hand and require you
  to bid 1N with a balanced hand. Other partnerships may prefer to always bid the 4 card major even with a balanced hand
- 1D--1H--2S (or 1C--1D--2H) are 2 level jump reverses. These are natural GF rebids, similar to non-reversing jump shift
  rebids (e.g. 1H--1S--3D). In these auctions we have to jump to differentiate the non-forcing from the GF hands. Note,
  some pairs choose to play a 1 level reverse as forcing for one round in which case these comments don't quite apply

This just leaves a 3 level jump reverse to be defined. The important point is that we can already GF with a simple
(non-jump) 2 level reverse, e.g. 1C--1S--2H, therefore the 3 level jump reverse 1C--1S--3H does not need a natural limit
bid meaning.

If you had no special agreements at all then something like 1C--1S--3H would likely be treated as a normal GF splinter,
but just started at a lower level leaving more room to investigate slam. This is a reasonable choice.

A couple of suggested options follows. Of the two options the (mini)splinter is more frequent but the artificial minor
single suited GF is much more useful when it comes up, so select (2) if unsure and find it easy enough to remember.

** (1) Mini-Splinter or Splinter

A mini-splinter is an invitational raise by opener, typically done in support of a major response.

The 1C--1S--3H rebid is a mini-splinter as you can still stop in 3M (3!s) when you have support and a !h singleton.

The 1D--1H--3S rebid is a splinter as you have gone past 3M (3!h).

Note, as we still need rebids such as 1D--1H--3C as a natural GF jump shift, then we don't have all the mini-splinters
available. These are the possible mini-splinter auctions that support a major:

- 1C--1S--3D
- 1C--1S--3H
- 1C--1H--3D
- 1D--1S--3H

...

- No 1C--1H then !s mini-splinter, only a normal splinter
- No 1D--1H then !s mini-splinter, only a normal splinter
- No 1D--1S then !c mini-splinter, only a normal splinter

Not all the options unless you restructure your agreements to make 1x--1y--1z (e.g. 1D--1H--1S) suit bids forcing, which
is hard to recommend, though might be playable paired with something like the XYZ convention - an extended way to play
[Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT](#Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT)

** (2) artificial minor single suited GF

For all those awkward hands that need to force to game but don't necessarily want to skip past 3N and indeed may want
to investigate slam.

Minor suits such as AKQxxxx with a side AK may have 9 playing tricks in strength. Generally we won't open a GF 2C
without enough tricks for game minus 1 (9 for a major, 10 for a minor), so we need better hands with minor single
suiters and at the same time are more likely to want to play 3N as it only needs 9 tricks with the right stops from
partner.

- 1C--1D--3H
- 1C--1H--3S
- 1C--1S--3H
- 1D--1H--3S
- 1D--1S--3H
- 1D--1N--3H

These rebids can all be used to show GF minor single suiters.

Not on after opening a major, e.g. 1H--1S--?, 1H--1N--?, 1S--1N--?. Bids like 1H--1S--4C, 1H--1N--3S or 1S--1N--4C would
usually be played as a splinter (when responder bids a suit) or self/auto-splinter over 1N (which is another form of
single suited GF, but requires a shortage).

Note, you may have better options after a 1H/1S opening if playing [Gazilli](#Gazilli - Rebidding Good Hands), but it is
more complicated.

** Jump 3N Rebid?

This bid is probably not worth its own section. If you are thinking about jump reverses then this may also come to mind.
When we play a 2N rebid as 18--19 and opening 2N as 20--21(+) then a jump to 3N is not needed to show a strong balanced
hand as it would have done in some older bidding styles (typically 19 hcp exactly).

- 1C/1D--1other--3N is often played as a solid 7 trick minor hand with partial stops in the other two suits. Not the
  sort of hand that wants to try make 5C/5D without extras from partner. The long minor means we may make game on fewer
  HCP than usual, without too many top controls.

- 1H--1S--3N is less clear, so perhaps avoid it. When undiscussed we would assume it shows a semi-balanced hand in the
  19--21 hcp range, not quite worth a 2C opening, but if the hand is that good a jump shift rebid maybe more appropriate
  (but perhaps we are light in top controls, best values in short suits?).  Showing a solid suit with partial stops is
  usually done by bidding game, but it could be played with the same meaning as over a minor, perhaps 7--2--2--2 or a
  shortage in partner's !s suit.

* Equal / Minimum Level Conversion Doubles

** Problem

The opponent opens on your right (RHO) and you also have an opening hand. When we don't have a normal takeout double
(ideally 4 cards in any unbid major and 3+ cards in any other suits) what do we bid? Sometimes you do have a 5 card suit
to overcall but you may also have another 4 card major that we want to explore for fit.

Sometimes you have 4--4 in the majors and a balanced hand without the points or stop to bid 1N and without length in the
remaining suit. If we double then partner may bid our short after which, bidding a new suit is a power double hand, a
hand too strong too overcall. Other times we may have a good 5/6 card minor to overcall but also a side 4 card major. If
we double we have the same problem if partner bids our short suit.

We may have something like 4--5 in the majors. When we overcall our 5 card !h suit and the opponents interfere further
will we have the strength and space to show our 4 card !s suit?

** Solution

Equal or Minimum Level Conversion Doubles are off-shape takeout doubles. When we bid a new suit after initially doing a
takeout double it is not a power double but just a correction to say that we are short in the suit bid by partner. With
very strong hands we have to do something else such as cue bid first to general force or jump higher. One trade off is
the lack of the usual takeout double then simple new suit bid to show a very strong overcall, but this comes up
infrequently and is rarely a problem even when it does.

The main trade off for being able to compete in more auctions is the increased ambiguity on what partner has for their
double and so how to respond to it!

- "Equal level" conversion style says that if you can bid a different suit at the one/two level then it's just
  conversion, not a power double
- "Minimum level" conversion style says that if you can bid a different suit without a jump then it's just conversion
- Equal level conversion can additionally by agreement be played after high level takeout doubles, e.g. after double a 3
  level preempt for takeout

We need to balance a style with the potential ambiguity of the double. With minimum conversion you may have to go to 3CD
in some auctions. Doubler may struggle even more to clearly show power double type hands.

Consider these situations with an off-shape double:

- (1H)--X with 4!ss + 5!ds or 4!ss + 6!ds playing equal conversion, easy to correct to !ds over !cs
- (1H)--X with 4!ss + 6!cs (with 5!cs you have to consider if correcting to 3C is your style and sensible) playing
  minimum conversion, but not equal conversion over a 2D response
- (1S)--X with 4!hs + minor, with !cs we may need to go to the 3 level yet partner may have nothing
- (1C)--X with 4--4 both majors, can you tolerate a 1D response?
- (1D)--X with 4--4 both majors, what do we do if partner bids !cs?
- (1C)--X with 5!hs + 4!ss, this trades off not showing 5!hs if they preempt !cs
- (1D)--X with 5!hs + 4!ss, similar but will have to correct to !hs at 2 level, still equal conversion
- (1D)--X with 5!ss + 4!hs, with interference we may be able to bid the lower !h suit naturally if we just overcall

From these situations we can say the following:

- it's unwise to double with 4--4 majors if partner may bid 2C with a 4 card suit, so adjust your takeout responses if
  needed
- Minimum Level Conversion is fine but may need a 6 card minor suit if correcting at the 3 level
- you may only want to convert if holding !ds as it can usually equally convert at the 2 level
- 5--4 majors can be bid naturally or double first, perhaps only with longer !hs. Doubling may quickly suggest both
  majors before a preempt by responder

There's no right answer on whether to double with 5--4 majors, perhaps it comes down to the suit quality of the 5 card
suit. Over a high level preempt it may be good to offer partner both majors with 5--4 - there is little space to
investigate.

*** A Suggested Style?

- allow 4--4 majors over (1C/1D) with a good opening or NV but adjust your takeout double responses
- play minimum converson including to !cs, but requires a good opening with 6 !cs and tolerance for a jump bid by
  partner
- disallow 5--4 majors

The simplest approach, played by some, is to only allow converting to !ds and only doing off-shaps doubles over a 1H/1S
opening.

*** Over 2x / 3x / 4x Preempts

Some players may believe that conversions are intuitive/obvious over preempts due to the space pressure of the preempt.
Bidding over a preempt can be based on what gives more chances to find a reasonable contract rather than sound in all
situations. No right answer, so discuss.

- (2H)--X--(P)--3C is a bid of 3D correction or showing extra values?
- (2S)--X--(P)--3D surely 4C, minimum conversion would be extras?
- (3C)--X--(P)--3H perhaps 3S should deny 4!hs as we still have room for 3N?
- (3D)--X--(P)--3S would you ever correct to the 4 level, seems we'd gamble on 3N instead?
- (3H)--X--(P)--4C is 4D a conversion or a strong force?
- (3H)--X--(P)--4D is 4HS a good suit or a conversion of some sort?

Seems like equal level conversion is ok, but going to the next level should be naturally strong/constructive.


*** Adjusting Your Takeout Double Responses

(1C/1D)--X = possibly 4--4 majors
  1HS = possibly 3 cards, only 4!cs
  1N = natural, but maybe poor stop
  2C = 5+ cards
    2D = 5+ conversion
  2HS = 5+ cards, ~8--11

(1H)--X = possibly 5 minor, 4 !ss
  2C = natural
    2D = 5+ conversion
  2S = 5+ cards, ~8--11

(1S)--X = possibly 5 minor, 4 !hs
  2C = natural
    2D = 5+ conversion

* Transfers After 1CD--(X)

** Problem

The opposition do a takeout double of our minor opening. We typically use XX to show values without any long suit bid,
perhaps some interest in taking a penalty. However, it's very rare to be able to penalise the opposition at the one
level when they have so much room (space to bid either major). Over 1H/1S--(X) there's more chance to penalise as they
may bid a new suit at the 2 level. Over a minor that's unlikely, so perhaps there's a better use for redouble?

** Solution

Redouble can be played as part of a transfer mechanism. The suits lengths can be 4 cards, much as they would be without
a double. With a transfer mechanism we put the takeout doubler on lead more often - letting opener, usually the stronger
hand, play the contract more often.

1C--(X)
  XX = !d transfer, 4+ cards
  1D = !h transfer, 4+ cards
    1H = 3 cards
    2H = 4 cards
    1N = 12--14, 2 card support
  1H = !s transfer, 4+ cards
    1S = 3 cards
    2S = 4 cards
    1N = 12--14, 2 card support
  1S = NT hand, weak
  1N = NT hand, invite
  2C = natural, 10+ hcp forcing (inverted)
  2N = both minors 5--5+, 8+ hcp

1D--(X)
  XX = !h transfer, 4+ cards
    1H = 3 cards
    2H = 4 cards
    1N = 12--14, 2 card support
  1H = !s transfer, 4+ cards
    1S = 3 cards
    2S = 4 cards
    1N = 12--14, 2 card support
  1S = NT hand, weak
  1N = NT hand, invite
  2C = natural, forcing
  2D = natural, 10+ hcp forcing (inverted)
  2N = both minors 5--5+, 8+ hcp

We could use 1N as a minor transfer instead of as a natural invite, but it's good being able to play 1N with an invite
instead of 2N possibly going one off.

Another small variation is to bid 1S with weak or GF flat hands without a major or good minor.

The jump bids of 2D/2H/2S are by default just system on - weak jump shifts or perhaps [Reverse Flannery](#Reverse Flannery Over 1C/1D).
As the opponents are on the way to find a fit already it may help to use these as a fit showing where the minor is has known length, e.g:

1D--(X)
  2HS = 5+ major 8+ hcp constructive, 4+ !d support


* Transfers Over 2N Rebid

** Problem

Bidding a variety of hand shapes and hand strengths after a 2N rebid (1x--1y--2N). Perhaps making opener declare the
contract. The problem is very similar to [Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT](#Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT), it's just
less frequent and the Checkback responses will be ok a lot of the time.

In our normal Checkback stayman structure we can use Checkback stayman to find a 5--3 major fit or 4--4 fit against a
unbid major. The other responses are forcing, so we do not have any way to sign off.

** Solution

Responder can use transfer bids, possibly with only a 4 card suit. If we have a 4--4 major fit to search for we transfer to
a new major then bid NT to offer a choice of games. If we have a 5 card major we transfer to that then bid NT to offer a
choice of games. We can transfer to !ds, !hs or !ss and pass to sign off with a dead minimum (!cs are often an exception, we cannot sign off with !cs).

Transfers hide more information about opener's hand compared to Checkback.

- 3C -> !d transfer
- 3D -> !h transfer, 5 cards if already bid, 4+ cards if it's a second suit
- 3H -> !s transfer, 5 cards if already bid, 4+ cards if it's a second suit
- 3S -> !c transfer, slam interest

Remember that you may hold a longer minor even if a major was bid first if lacking values for an invite opposite a
minimum opening hand.

* Transfer Lebensohl Over 2 Level Interference

** Problem

The main situation is when we open (or overcall) 1N, then the opponents interfere and we want to sort out competitive
v.s. invitational v.s. game forcing hands, and perhaps whether we have a stop or a 4 card side major. By agreement you
can extend it to other situations:

- 1NT--(Overcall)  (but not 2!c as just ignore)
- (1X)--1NT Overcall by us including Protective--(bid over)
- 1C--(2!d!h!s)
- 1D--(2!h!s)
- (1H)–X–(2H) (advanced partnerships may prefer reversed Lebensohl here)
- (1S)–X–(2S)
- 1H--(2S) (another possible reversed Lebensohl situation, though 2N as major raise maybe better)
- (Weak 2!d!h!s)--X
- (1C prepared/short)--2C natural
- (1D prepared/short)--2D natural
- (2D multi)--X
- (1NT)--X--(XX Escape)
- (1NT)--X--(2D+ Escape) (but not 2!c escape as just ignore)
- (1NT)--P--(2x)--X

The first two or three situations are the main ones. You have to agree all but the most obvious first situation. If we
open a minor it's common to hold a NT like hand so using Lebensohl after a 2 level weak jump overcall can help, but also
just bidding 2 level new suit forcing, 3 level game forcing and double negative/takeout is reasonable.

** Solution

This is another variant of Lebensohl that covers more than [Better Minor Lebensohl](#Lebensohl - Defending Weak 2HS),
(Better Minor is recommended for responding to a weak two takeout double). Look at that variant first. Also take note of
[Reversed Lebensohl](#Reversed Lebensohl) if you want a more tuned Lebensohl for situations where partner is unbalanced
and you have the option of passing.

- we insist on playing *negative doubles* instead of penalty doubles when the opponents interfere. Negative doubles
  remove the need for any staymanic cue bids (typically denying vs showing a stop if bidding 2N first). The cue bid can
  now show a GF with shortage in the opponent's suit, a common shape being 5--4--3--1 with 3 cards in another major
  that is unsuitable for a negative double (or any staymanic cue bid)
- with transfer Lebensohl you show an invitational or better 5+ card suit with a transfer (though !cs is always a more
  difficult suit to show). You show your invite plus suited hands before the other opponent bids (in traditional
  Lebensohl some invite hands have to start with 2N giving the opponents more time to interfere). The transfer may give
  you more room to describe your hand as well as the side benefit of letting opener play the contract with the
  overcaller put on lead. As this is a transfer system, you have to decide if the suit below the opponent's is a
  transfer into their suit and so a cue bid or a transfer through to the higher suit. We choose *transfer through*
- in transfer Lebensohl 2N is mainly for any weak/competitive hands (that don't have space to be bid at the 2 level) or
  a !c GF. However, we can also go via 2N if we just want to bid 3N slowly. It's up to you whether slow shows a stop or
  fast shows a stop (bidding 3N immediately). Fast shows is maybe more intuitive but it should be discussed. A slow 3N
  usually implies no 4 card major (no negative double), no 5+ other suit and so usually a !c suit, though possibly not
  very long
- note there are lots of Lebensohl variants as we mentiond within the Better Minor Lebensohl section, so it's good to
  discuss how !cs are shown and what bidding 2N means. There are similarly named and almost the same Lebensohl variants
  that involve some transferring. Some bids have no obvious meaning, but some alternative meanings have been mentioned
  below. One example is over 2S interference you can play 3H as weak competitive instead of going via 2N to get your
  suit in quickly before 4th hand also interferes. This variant is less useful when our side bids 1N as the 1N bidder is
  unlikely to raise your !h suit with less than 5 cards if the other opponent raises !ss. It's more beneficial when our
  side open something like 1C/1D and we are playing Lebensohl over jump interference
- only applies over 2D, 2H and 2S. System is on over 2C with X being a Stayman replacement (Stolen double), though you
  should have an exception for a X/2C/2D bid showing majors over our 1N - Stayman and transfers is not needed so use
  double/XX to show values

* Reverse Flannery Over 1C/1D

** Problem

Some responder hands cannot easily show 5!s + 4!hs or perhaps 5!s + 5!hs, notably when responder has less than GF
strength.

The sequence 1D--1S--2C is the most concerning. 2H is fourth suit forcing and playing in 2C or 2D might be
terrible, possibly missing a !h fit. Rebidding 2S could end up in a 5--1 or even 5--0 fit.

Another sequence, 1D--1S--2D may also be difficult. With a weak hand it's easy to bid 2H, what about invitational
hands with both majors? Well, we could still bid 2H and expect partner to raise if they have support, but then we maybe
too high already.

** Solution

One approach, that many are already doing, is to ignore it and just do your best when the hand comes up. You may prefer
to play the bids as a weak jump shift, which is reasonably frequent. Whilst reverse flannery shape hands come up fairly
often, it is less common for them to be a problem.

Reverse Flannery, the two way version gets these problematic hands shapes across immediately.

1m--2H = 5!ss + 4 or 5!hs weak
  2N = ask, game try+
    3C = min 5--4
    3D = max 5--4
    3H = min 5--5
    3S = max 5--5
  3m = sign off
  4m = GF, natural single suiter

1m--2S = 5!ss + 4 or 5!hs invitational
  2N = ask, game try+
    3C = min 5--4
    3D = max 5--4
    3H = min 5--5
    3S = max 5--5
  3m = sign off
  4m = GF, natural single suiter

An advantage of reverse flannery is also had on knowing you don't have those hands in some other auctions, e.g:

- 1D--1S--1N--2H is probably 6--4 weak
- 1D--1S--2H--3H is also likely 6--4


*** Preserving 2S as weak jump shift?

Just play, 1m--2H as weak, but 2S as a weak jump shift. With the invitational hands we can fall back on just trying our
best.

Over 1C there's the options to use 2D as a reverse flannery bid, though the opponent's may double it for lead.

1C--2D = 5!ss + 4 or 5!hs weak
1C--2H = 5!ss + 4 or 5!hs invitational

1D--2H = 5!ss + 4 or 5!hs weak
1D--2S = weak jump shift

*** Other Adjustments

If a partnership always rebids a 4 card major instead of 1N in 1x--1y--1z auctions then it may let you come up with
specific meanings for other auctions. When we always rebid 1S with 4 cards in a 1D--1H--1S auction and we also play
reverse flannery then some bids have no obvious meaning. Bids done through [Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT](#Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT)
can be given some unexpected meanings:

**** 1D--1S--1N--2C--2D--2H

In this two way new minor forcing auction then 2H could be GF instead of the usual expected invitational meaning as
the 1D--2S takes care of the invite hands.

**** 1D--1S--1N--2H

Not needed for NF weak hands. One special meaning could a very good invite !s invite, meaning that
1D--1S--1N--2C--2D--2S bid would be a weaker invite implying the need for 3 cards and a max support.

**** 1D--1H--1N--2C--2D--2S

If always rebidding 1S with 4 cards then this 2S can be artificial showing a very good !h invite, so again the alternative
of 1D--1H--1N--2C--2D--2H would be a weaker invite implying the need for 3 cards and a max support.


* 5N Pick a Slam

** Problem

Some hands we know we should be in a slam, but there's no particularly good auction to get more useful information out of
partner.

- 1N--2C--2H

With this normal stayman sequence opener could still have 4!ss. They may have a 4 card minor suit we could play in.
Perhaps you could bid 3C/3D with a 4 card minor (even though it should show 5+ cards), however, you want partner to bid
!ss if they have them instead of raising the minor or trying 3N instead.

- 1N--2D--2H

This could be a choice of slam type hand. We don't want to set !hs as trumps if we only have 5 cards, but we may have
the strength to force to slam. If we don't have a side 4 card suit then we don't want to bid a new minor.

** Solution

The 5N bid can be played as pick a slam, letting partner help decide where to go. As part of this it a good idea to
throw out 5N as quantitative to reduce any potential confusion!

Note, it should obviously not be 5N pick a slam after Roman Keycard where 5N is a King ask!

- Essentially, if it's not Roman Keycard related then 5N is pick a slam.

To respond to 5N you show shape and/or strength that partner is unaware of. An unbid side suit, a better than expected
main suit or better support than indicated are all common. Sometimes you just have a flat hand with good stops and bid
NT.

*** What are some example picks on offer?

When forced to bid at the 5 level by competition:

- big two suiter: 1H--(5C)--5N
- opener having moderate support plus 4!cs aswell as their own suit: 1S--(5D)--5H--5N
- by skipping 5N we imply 5--5: 1S--(5D)--5H--6C
- equal preference for two suiter, slam going: 1D--(4S)--4N--5N, therefore 5S cue is grand slam try

After control bidding:

- Implication that a control bid suit has length: 1H--3H--4D--5C--5N (!ds maybe very strong and !hs weak)

After heading to a NT contract, may prefer a minor or even major:

- good !ds worried about !cs in 6N: 1D--1H--3D--3S--3N--4N--5N
- either minor or NT is possible, but not great !cs, only 3!ds: 1D--2C--2N--5N


* Fit Jumps in Competition

** Problem

Finding double fits in competitive auctions and having to decide whether to bid at the 5 level or whether game v.s. slam
is worth going to.

** Solution

Fit jumps are one of many contributors to judging hand fit in competitive auctions. Fit jumps show a good 5+ side suit
(a source of tricks) and support for partner's suit (4+ for major, 5+ for minor). The values are generally appropriate
to the level of bidding, i.e invitational plus 3 level or game forcing at the 4 level etc.

Note, an alternative to fit jumps could be splinter bids or weak jump shifts. However, as the opponent(s) have already
bid it maybe better to find a fit with partner instead of unilaterally preempting. A splinter of the opponent's suit may
occasionally be useful, even for competitive reasons, but a splinter in a new suit would be slam focussed which is rare
after the opponents have bid.

Our base system already uses fit jumps by a *passed hand*, e.g:

- 1C--2D/2H/2S
- 1D--2H/2S/3C
- 1H--2S/3C/3D
- 1S--3C/3D/3H

Now we want to extend them to competition. General rules for when to use them:

- opponent(s) and partner have both bid
- partner has shown a natural 5+ card suit
- below any game contract
- the jump doesn't have a more important predefined use, which often means that we have another way to show a forcing
  hand with the jumped to suit
- double jumps below game are fit jumps iff a fit jump is not available as a single jump, e.g. because a single jump
  shows a natural invitational suit, a 1-under mixed raise or some other agreement
- when a single and double jump is available the double jump below game should show a splinter raise (though by
  agreement it could instead be used to show a stronger fit jump)

*** Fit Jumps When We Simple Overcall

Our standard use for advancer's single jump shift is to show a strong forcing hand (though you can choose to do without
such strong jump shifts). That still leaves room for some double jumps as fit jump, e.g:

- (1C)--1S--(P)--4D
- (1D)--1H--(P)--4C

*** Fit Jumps When We Open They Overcall

- 1H--(1S)--3C
- 1H--(1S)--3D  (optional - some may play a 1 under jump as a mixed raise)
- 1H--(1S)--4D  (optional - if 3D used as a mixed raise, otherwise splinter)
- 1H--(2C)--3D  (optional - again, fit jump or mixed raise)
- 1H--(2C)--3S
- 1S--(2D)--4C

*** Fit Jumps When They Double

- 1D--(X)--2S  (optional - may continue playing as NF costructive natural)
- 1D--(X)--3S  double jump replacement

*** Fit Jumps By Opener

Again, in competition...

- 1D--(1S)--2H--(2S)--4C/4D

* More Doubling - Stolen, Maximal, Activity

Some other common doubling situations.

** Stolen

- when the opponents cue bid our suit, discuss if X is extra length or values - stolen would suggest it means we
  would happily bid it
- when the opponents X our suit artificially, discuss if XX is extra length or values - stolen would suggest it means we
  would happily bid it (again)
- when the opponents X or cue partner's suit artificially or takeout, a stolen X or XX says we would like to make that
  bid

If we've not supported partner's suit some players may think that XX is SOS for escape. Needs discussion.

** Maximal

Shows an invitational good 3 level bid of our sides suit in competition.

- both sides support each other and we have a choice between bidding 3 of our suit or doubling
- 1!h–(2D)–2!h–(3D)–X shows a good 3H bid whilst bidding 3H is just competitive

There's little point in it being penalty (unless there's no chance of game) when the opponents support each
other at the 2 or 3 level and we also support our suit. Takeout also makes no sense as we already have a fit.

Note if an opponent bid a new suit at the 3 level and we already have a fit then double should be penalty. Showing an
invite maybe useful, but if they bid without support at the 3 level we have to be ready to penalise.

** Activity

Activity just means encouraging more bidding e.g. a sacrifice.

- when the opponents show a short suit that does not make much sense for us to lead, such as a splinter, then despite us
  apparently lacking strength, double should be for activity, in this case a potential sacrifice

A known weak hand that has already described themselves, i.e. with a preempt could also be for activity.

- a weak hand that has already described some offensive ability, such as a weak two, cannot reasonably have a penalty
  double of any game the opponents bid, UNLESS partner has had space to show GF values and defense.

Double by such a weak player would suggest extreme shape for their preempt and shortage in the opponents suit.


* More Redoubling - Stop Ask, Artificial

** Artificial Suit Double, e.g. Fourth Suit Forcing, Stayman etc.

- a catchall meta agreement is to say that XX is for strong play suggestion (e.g. 4 very good / 5+ reasonable suit)
- pass can optionally be used to suggest something like Hxx, which is a stop, which might be used to play the contract
  if partner has a good holding
- Otherwise bid on as if not doubled. With a stop we may choose to show the stop or pass to suggest playing the contract.

** Stop Ask XX

We may cue bid an opponents suit, or do some similar bid to specifically ask for a stop. What to do if the opponents
double it for lead?

- XX shows a partial stop
- NT shows a good stop
- optionally pass could show something like xxxx, the worst partial stop, but generally bid on as normal with anything
  but a partial stop


* Meckwell Responses to Michaels / Unusual

** Problem

Opposite the offensive potential of a 5--5+ two suiter hand we don't need much for game, we just need the right fitting
features and our responses should take advantage of that. Using a simple range ask or point based raise misses the
importance of fitting features. We would like to have invites available because the two suiter overcalls can have a wide
range, especially when NV and not forcing partner to the 3 level.

** Solution

Having lots of points is not as important as where they are and what they are:

- any honour in partner's suits is a feature (including J with some length)
- an Ace or King in any suit is a feature
- a shortage in partner's other suit is a feature

Extra trump length is also very important, so it helps to be able show a mixed raise of a major (4 card support and ~7--9
support points) whilst counting features.

(1D)--2D
  2HS = preference
  3C = !h limit+ raise, 3 features for invite, 3+ card support
  3D = !s limit+ raise, 3 features for invite, 3+ card support
  3HS = 2 features, mixed raise, 4 card support, typically 7--9 support points
  4D = pick a major
  4HS = obstructive, possibly very weak 5+ card support

Points to note about responding to this 2D Michael's bid:

- we do not use 2N as an artificial range ask as is played in the base system
- 3CD are both artificial, it shows features and support for a specific major
- the 3CD bids are limit plus raises (could be game values or just invitational ~8--11), we may want to investigate slam or
  prepare for the opponents sacrifice instead of jumping to game
- the power of 4 card support means that just 2 features is enough to push towards game with the 3HS mixed raise

Over 2C Michael's you can play the same structure, but with the extra space you can additionally include an artificial
2D relay instead so we can stay at the 2 level with a 3 card + 3 feature type raise:

(1C)--2C
  2D = relay, weak major preference signoff type hands
    2H = relayed
      P = to play, worse than immediate 2H raise
      2S = to play
  2HS = limit+ raise, 3+ card support
  3HS = 2 features, mixed raise, 4 card support, typically 7--9 support points
  4C = pick a major
  4HS = obstructive, possibly very weak 5+ card support

(1H)--2H
  2N = minor ask, invite plus
    3CD = !c/!d minimum
    3HS = !c/!d, extra values
  3C = pass or correct
  3D = artificial Meckwell !s game try, good !s raise (e.g. 3 card + 3 features)
  3S = 2 features, mixed raise, 4 card support, typically 7--9 support points

(1S)--2S
  2N = minor ask, invite plus
    3CD = !c/!d minimum
    3HS = !c/!d, extra values
  3C = pass or correct
  3D = artificial Meckwell !h game try, good !s raise (e.g. 3 card + 3 features, 4 card + 2 features)
  3H = preference, limited
  3S = good 4!h bid, offensive e.g. !s shortage

(1C)--2N
  3C = !h raise, 2 features with fit
  3DH = preference
  3S = natural, NF
  4D = good hand, 3 card + 3 features, 4 card + 2 features

(1D)--2N
  3CH = preference
  3D = !h raise, 2 features with fit
  3S = natural, NF
  4C = good hand, 3 card + 3 features, 4 card + 2 features

(1H)--2N
  3CD = preference
  3H = general force, later 4CD is a slam try
  3S = natural, NF
  4CD = good hand, 3 card + 3 features, 4 card + 2 features

(1S)--2N
  3CD = preference
  3H = natural, NF
  3S = general force, later 4CD is a slam try
  4CD = good hand, 3 card + 3 features, 4 card + 2 features

*** Bid Strengths?

What is an invite? What should be a simple preference? This depends on how strong you think the two suit bidder is. Two
suiter bids can vary in strength.

- Less than *strong* (not mini-maxi style), with strong defined as 8+PT ~17+ hcp
- If playing [Strong Michaels](#Strong Michaels, Leaping Michaels) Majors have a dedicated jump cue for strong two
  suiters, others must start with a takeout double
- Spot cards in the long suits make a difference
- 6--5 shape is great, perhaps 3 hcp better than the equivalent 5--5
- Playing at the 3 level needs better suit quality, especially VUL...
- The !h + minor 2!s cue and 2N force to the 3 level in both suits so need good quality
- The 2N extra quality accounts for us having the lowest ranked suits, so less likely to win the auction
- HCP outside your suits unless Ace or King have very little value - we want *offensive hands* that can make a game
  opposite very little

Hand examples:

- Majors showing NV: most aggressive ~6+, min KJxxx (Q9|J10)xxx
- Majors showing VUL: ~9+, also a reasonable 2 level overcall, min K109xx AQxxx
- !s + minor showing NV: ~9+ values IN the two suits, min KJxxx Jx x AJxxx
- !s + minor showing VUL: ~10+ values IN the two suits, better spot cards or more hcp, min KQ10xx AJxxx
- !h + minor showing NV: ~10+ values IN the two suits, min QJ10xx AKxxx
- !h + minor showing VUL: bit better, 2H overcall is often safer, utter min x AQxxx Qx Kxxxx
- 2N unusual NV vs. VUL: extra aggressive where sacrifice suggestion sensible, e.g. 6--5 Kxxxx Qxxxxx
- 2N unusual NV vs. NV: ~10+ values IN the two suits, min QJ10xx AKxxx
- 2N unusual VUL: AJ109x KQxxx


*** With interference

When the opponents open and raise a major, which takes more space, we use the same structure, only higher. The !d suit
is an artificial raise.

(1S)--2S--(3S)
  3N = to play
  4C = pass or correct
  4D = good !h raise
  4H = to play
  4N = minor ask, some slam interest

(1S)--2S--(4S)
  4N = minor ask, some slam interest
  5C = pass or correct
  5D = good !h raise
  5H = competitive, possible sacrifice


* Strong Michaels, Leaping Michaels

** Problem

A 5--5+ two suiter is a powerful offensive distribution that may have limited utility in defense. Ideally we
communicate the shape in just one bid before the opponents can preempt the bidding. That we are second to bid and the
opponents can preempt the bidding is the main reason bids like Michael's cue bid and the unusual NT are made with
a very wide range of strengths. In the past players might use a "mini-maxi" style where something like a (1!h)--2H
Michael's cue bid promised 8--11 or 16+ hcp whilst with the intermediate 12--15 hcp hands you would just overcall
naturally, however much of the hands offensive potential is maybe preempted out of the bidding.

Especially if NV, a Michael's cue such as (1!d)--2D can be as weak as 6 hcp whilst in theory being unlimited where it
would help to have a separate bid for extra strong two suiters. The are other auctions such as a weak two opening by the
opponents where showing a two suiter can be important.

** Solutions

*** Strong Michaels

A strong Michael's cue is a jump cue bid, usually only to show the majors specifically - (1!c)--3C or (1!d)--3D. These
hands are roughly 8+ playing tricks, 17+ hcp. Partner will usually bid game with any useful feature. Features are an
Ace/King in the opponents suit, a top honour in partner's suits with support, or shortage in one of partner's suit and
support.

(1D)--3D = majors, strong
    4C = cue bid, slam try
    4D = choose a major

*** Leaping Michaels

Leaping Michael's is a jump over a preempt, typically a weak two. Unlike Strong Michaels this gives up a natural bid -
it removes your ability to do a 4 level strong jump overcall in a minor - you can only bid 3CD or 5CD. As it's quite
rare, you may not want to play this convention. Either way it can be combined with a normal Michael's cue over the preempt

(2D) = weak
  3D = majors
  4C = !cs + !hs, GF
    4D = (advanced) !h slam try
    4N = (advanced) !c slam try
  4D = !cs + !ss, GF
    4N = (advanced) !c slam try
  4N = both minors

(2H) = weak
  3H = !ss + minor, limited
    3S = to play
    4C = pass/correct
    4D = good 4!s bid
    4N = good minor ask
      5HS = extras, good !c/!d holding
  4C = !cs + !ss, GF
    4D = (advanced) !s slam try
    4H = (advanced) !c slam try
  4D = !ds + !ss, GF
    4H = (advanced) !s slam try
    5C = (advanced) !d slam try
  4H = (advanced) both minors slam interest, 3 losers max
  4N = both minors

(2S) = weak
  3S = !hs + minor, limited
    4C = pass/correct
    4D = good 4!h bid
    4N = good minor ask
      5HS = extras, good !c/!d holding
  4C = !cs + !hs, GF
    4D = (advanced) !h slam try
    4S = (advanced) !c slam try
  4D = !ds + !hs, GF
    4S = (advanced) !h slam try
    4C = (advanced) !d slam try
  4S = (advanced) both minors slam interest, 3 losers max
  4N = both minors

*** Non-Leaping Michaels (advanced) over 3 Level Preempts

A rarer treatment where we give up a natural 4CD overcall to show a two suiter. A jump (leaping) Michael's overcall can
still show a GF hand, but a Non-Leaping bid is non-forcing.

(3C)
    4C = majors two suiter, GF ~4 losers
    4D = !ds + major, GF ~ 4 losers
    4N = !hs + !ds, ~3 losers
    5D = natural, roughly 4 level strong jump overcall values

(3D)
    4C = !cs + major, NF non-leaping
    4D = majors two suiter, GF ~ 4 losers
    4N = !hs + !cs, ~3 losers
    5C = natural, roughly 4 level strong jump overcall values

(3H)
  4C = !cs + !ss, NF non-leaping
  4D = !ds + !ss, NF non-leaping
  4H = GF, !ss + minor
  4N = minors
  5CD = natural, roughly 4 level strong jump overcall values

(3S)
  4C = !cs + !hs, NF non-leaping
  4D = !ds + !hs, NF non-leaping
  4S = !hs + minor, ~3 losers
  4N = minors
  5CD = natural, roughly 4 level strong jump overcall values


* Two Suiters in 4th

Continuing the theme of showing distributional offensive hands quickly, there are some other situations that are not as
widely discussed.

** Opponents Bid Two Suits First

(1x)--P--(1y)
  2x = Michaels
  2y = natural

You would expect the cue bid of the lower suit to be Michaels without much discussion, but cue bidding the higher suit
is less obvious. Standard treatment is a natural overcall (perhaps responder only had 4 cards and you have 6+ good
cards).

** (1H)--P--(1S) Oddity

Using a standard 2H meaning is no different to 2NT to show 5--5, it's the same two suits and goes to the 3 level.

(1H)--P--(1S)
  2H = !ss and a minor, 5--5+

So, we show 5--5 including the opponent's nominal spade suit.

** (1N)--P--(2D/2H)

This is a normal transfer by the opponents. If you have no special agreement in this auction then you might it expect it
to be Michaels, yet many would use bidding a transfer suit as takeout.

(1N)--P--(2D)
  2H = michaels, !ss + minor

(1N)--P--(2D)
  2S = michaels, !hs + minor

A two suiter is more likely to reach game than any normal takeout double hand, therefore pass then double with a normal
takeout.

(1N)--P--(2D)--P--(2H)--P--(P)
  Dbl = takeout


** After (1m)--P--(1N)

If you don't mind giving up an overcall of the other minor, and can remember it, then consider this approach.

(1C)--P--(1N)
  2C = 5--4 majors
    2D = longest suit ask
  2D = 5--5 majors

(1D)--P--(1N)
  2C = 5--4 majors
    2D = longest suit ask
  2D = 5--5 majors

Without a special agreement the cue bid would be 5--5 and you will have to double for takeout with anything else.

** After the (1S)--P--(2S) Raise

(1S)--P--(2S)
  2N = !hs + minor, Michaels

Without discussion you'd expect it to be unusual, the lowest suits, but the chance of a major game is far more important

* (1S)--3C Two Suiter

** Problem

A typical competitive Michael's auction such as (1S)--2S--(3S) makes it hard for advancer to decide how far to bid on
without knowing which minor the two suit overcaller has.

** Solution

Over the opponents 1S we can use 3 bids to show two suiters:

(1S)
  2S = !hs + !ds any strength OR !hs + !cs strong
  2N = minors
  3C = !hs + !cs limited

This sort of scheme to be able to show two specific suits is known as the Ghestem convention or other names depending on
the exact details. 3C can be used as two suiter showing over any opening bid. The main downside is losing the 3C weak
jump overcall, which although the easiest 3 level jump overcall to defend against, is still reasonably frequent. Often
the biggest downside is simply forgetting the meaning of the bid.

The suggested approach only uses it over a 1S opening as the top rank !s suit is the hardest to compete over when the
opponents raise it. If the 2S Michaels cue bidder does not have !ds you know they have a very powerful hand. Even if you
forgot the meaning of the 3C bid, at least they have !cs, which is not true of all Ghestem like bids.


* Defending Raises in 4th Position

Opponents have a basic raising auction.

- (1x)--P--(2x)
- (1x)--P--(3x)
- (1x)--P--(3y) artificial raise, e.g. Bergen
- (2x)--P--(3x)
- (2x)--P--(4x)
- (3x)--P--(4x)

One meta-agreement to deal with all these situations is, if the raise is to 2D or higher then just treat it as if they
opened the bidding at that level. Whatever tricks you play over a weak two or weak three etc. can be played here. We
just have to be more careful as opener is sitting over us and has some values!

- (1D)--P--(2D) as if opened 2D
- (1H)--P--(2H) as if opened 2H, but consider recommended 2N exception showing minors
- (1S)--P--(2S) as if opened 2S, but consider recommended 2N exception showing !hs + minor
- (1x)--P--(3x) as if opened 3x
- (1x)--P--(3y) as if opened 3x
- (2x)--P--(3x) as if opened 3x
- (2x)--P--(4x) as if opened 4x
- (3x)--P--(4x) as if opened 4x


* 3 Plus Level Interference Handling

** Problem

The opponents have launched the bidding to the 3 level (or higher) before partner has made a bid in response.
This can be very annoying. What are our options to constructively bid and show different lengths, or separate invite v.s
competitive vs game forcing hands? Some example auctions:

- 1C--(3D)
- 1D--(3x)
- 1N--(3x)
- 1HS--(3x)
- (1H)--1S--(3H)
- (1H)--1S--(3C) support showing bid
- (1H)--1S--(3C) anything, not shortage showing
- (1H)--X--(3H)
- (1H)--X--(3C) support showing bid
- (1H)--X--(3C) anything, not shortage showing
- (1H)--2D--(3H)
- (1H)--2S--(3H) our weak jump overcall
- (2D)--X--(3D)
- (2H)--X--(3H) weak two preempted further
- (2H)--2S--(3H)
- (2D)--2S--(3H) multi preempted further

** Solution

Some more transfers and different types of doubles. To explain this properly we have to consider the different types of
hands our side has shown with the first bid:

- we open 1H or 1S, so we have a known natural 5+ card suit
- we open a 1CD natural minor, may be long but possibly only 4 cards and a balanced hand
- we open a 1CD short/prepared minor, chances are we have a balanced hand
- we overcall, so a known 5+ card suit
- we jump overcall, a known 6+ suit

*** Relay Doubles When We Show a Major or Natural 5+ Suit then 3CDH Interference

So, 1S--(3H), (1H)--1S--(3H) etc. This is instead of a normal negative/takeout double.

1S--(3C)
  Dbl = relay
    3D = relayed
      P = competitive long !ds
      3H = competitive long !hs
      3S = competitive
      3N = no stop, game values
    other = extras
  3S = invitational

1S--(3H)
  Dbl = relay
    3S = relayed
      P = competitive
      3N = no stop, game values, maybe minors based hand
      4CD = competitive
    other = extras
  3S = invitational

If we open !hs and there is 3S interference, there is naturally no room for relay doubles!

*** Relay Doubles After We Takeout Double to Show a Major

Such as (1H)--X--(3H). Partner may only have 4 cards here, but the relay double works fine here as well at the cost of
not having a normal responsive takeout double. In those situations it maybe difficult to bid with both minors.

(1H)--X--(3H)
  Dbl = relay
    3S = relayed
      P = competitive
      3N = no stop, game values, maybe minors based hand
      4CD = competitive
    other = extras
  3S = invitational

*** Some Transfers After We Open Minor or NT hands

We are known to be or probably are balanced and have not shown a natural 5+ major suit.

When we have a NT hand we play doubles as penalty in the base system, but players may use it as takeout. After a suit
opening and overcall it's a negative/takeout double. In the little space we have we try to use some transfers to show
a 5+ suit and invitational or better hands. This is instead of the standard "new suit game forcing at the 3 level".

1D/1N--(3C)
  3DH = transfer, mild invite plus
  3S = !d artificial GF

1C/1N--(3D)
  3H = !s transfer, invite plus
  3S = !hs artificial GF

These transfers bids and switched bids maybe rare enough that you question how useful they are.

*** Thrump Doubles After We Open Minor or NT hands

If not playing double as penalty, e.g. 1C--(3!d) would normally be negative/takeout anyway, then Thrump maybe more
useful. Some players maybe doing this without really agreeing it anyway. The idea is that 1CD/1N--(3DHS) then double is
still a negative like double but the main focus is on asking for a stop - you may not have a side major.

*** 3S or Higher Interference

At this point there is little room left.

**** We Have a Major

Only a couple of tricks here and given the rarity, may not be worth it!

1H--(3S)
  Dbl = could be stop asking or normal !h raise
  4CD = GF, natural
  4H = slam try

Opener may not know that we have a normal !h raise if 4H is used as a slam try, but they will know we have game values
when we double.

1HS--(4C)
  4D = artificial, 15+ good !h raise (slam try)

**** We Have a Minor or Balanced Hand

Only over !cs is there something different.

1D/1N--(4C)
  4D = !h transfer
  4H = !s transfer
  4S = !ds

* Opener's Good-Bad 2N Rebid

** Problem

When both opponents overcall/interfere and partner responds then how can opener show a good suit or suits with
competitive values at the 3 level and yet also show stronger ~16+ hcp hands?

- 1C--(1S)--X--(2S)
- 1D--(1H)--1S--(2H)

- only when we can have a competitive long suit and have not been supported by responder. So, it will not apply when
  opening 1NT
- only if game is possible, otherwise we don't need to show different strengths
- only if the auction is not in a game force already, we're going to game anyway
- only if the 4th hand's bid was 2D/2H/2S, otherwise we have lots of space to bid naturally

** Solution

When opener rebids 2N in these live auctions it shows a competitive hand, could be length in the opening suit or a two
suiter. Bidding naturally at the 3 level is strong, values for a 3 level bid. Note opener could use a support double to
show 3 card support for responder's suit. If opener really had a natural 2N rebid of 18--19 hcp then they could just bid
3N with a stop.

1D--(1H)--1S--(2H)
  2S = natural !s support, limited opening
  2N = competitive hand
    3CD = will play if opener is competitive with that suit
  3CD = ~16+ hcp, natural

* Advancer's Good 2N

** Problem

Differentiating invites v.s competitive bids in a live auction below 2N.

In the base system we would assume any of the following auctions to be a natural 2N:

- (1D)--2C--(2D)--2N
- (1S)--2H--(2S)--2N

However, how can we show a competitive !h raise v.s. an invite in this last example?

** Solution

When the auction is live (meaning responder also bids) and we are the overcalling + advancing side, then a natural 2N is
rarely useful (unless perhaps the opponents are playing negative free bids so that their new suit at the 2 level is
possibly very weak).

In the initial example auctions we have the lower ranked suit, therefore showing a good raise with a cue bid takes us
too high. Using 2N for a good raise is better, e.g:

(1D)--2C--(2D)
  2N = good !c raise
  3C = competitive !c raise

(1S)--2H--(2S)
  2N = good !h raise
  3H = competitive !h raise

What about cases where we have the higher ranked suit? Here we can still bid 2S or cue bid to show a good raise without
forcing partner to the 4 level. Even so, we can use 2N to show a better v.s. good raise, which is usually an invite with
3 cards v.s. 4 cards. You can play it as specifically as 3 v.s. 4 card invites.

(1D)--1S--(2D)
  2S = competitive
  2N = best !s invite, usually 4 cards
  3D = good !s raise, usually 3 cards
  3S = preemptive, 4+ !ss

Remember Advancer's artificial 2N applies only in a live auction, it's still natural if responder passed. However,
partnerships can specially agree that 2N is only natural if responder passes and it's non-jump 2N...this usually assumes
that something like [Advancer's 2C Relay](#Advancer's 2C Relay) can be played to handle invite hands.

(1D)--1S--(P)
  2D = good !s raise
  2S = competitive
  2N = natural or the best !s raise, your partnership choice
  3D = jump cue, often played as a mixed raise
  3S = preemptive, 4+ !ss

(1H)--2D--(P)
  2H = good !d raise
  2N = natural
  3D = competitive
  3H = splinter as passed 3D
  4D = preemptive


* Advancer's 2C Relay

** Problem

We overcall 1H/1S and responder passes. Overcalls have a wide point range, e.g. 8--16 hcp, maybe even a "bad" 17 hcp
hand, so it can be difficult to judge how high to bid (in modern competitive bidding there's much incentive to show your
suit and shape before the opponents compete, so we prefer to takeout double with a hand too strong to overcall only if
it's very good).

As mentioned in [Advancer's Good 2N](#Advancer's Good 2N), we might use a jump 2N to show the "best" raise, e.g. 4 cards
and if playing [Mixed Raises](#Mixed Raises with Jacoby Plus) we have more options when it comes to supporting partner
aswell as the usual cue bid raise.

What if we do not have support? Maybe a natural 2N with 13--15 hcp is a useful bid when responder has passed, perhaps
more useful than using it to show the "best" raise. What if we do not have a good stop? A new suit is natural
non-forcing ~8--12 hcp. A jump shift is strong natural 16+ hcp in the base system. Even if we play that, are we going to
jump on some poor suits?

** Solution

An artificial 2C bid for all those catchall hands that wants to get more information out of partner, e.g:

- 9+ hcp with Hx support, often flattish, would like to know if partner has 6 cards
- 13+ hcp catchall (semi)balanced with no support
- setting up a force, with some hand too good to just bid naturally

Like many conventions this can make the !c suit hard to bid. As part of this solution a jump shift response could be
played as natural 6+ suit and invitational (hence 2!c maybe needed to setup a force). You still won't have a bid to show
the weaker ~8--11(12) NF !c suit.

(1D)--1S--(P)
  2C = artificial advancers relay
  2D = good !s raise
  2H = NF, constructive
  2S = natural raise
  2N = either natural or best !s raise (partnership choice)
  3CH = invitational 6+ good suit
  3D = jump cue, mixed raise (if playing mixed raises)
  3S = natural raise, ~4--7 semi-preemptive/cooperative
  4C = fit jump (if playing fit jumps)
  4D = splinter

Responses to 2C are mostly natural except 2D artificially shows 12+ hcp by overcaller and the optional 2N bid which is
similar to [Gazilli](#Gazilli - Rebidding Good Hands). Example:

(1CD)--1H--2C
    2D = artificial, 12+ hcp
      2H = NF, ~9--11 Hx (or xxx not worth initial cue bid)
      2S = F1, natural (unusual given possible 1!s response)
      2N = GF waiting, ~12+ hcp
      cue = F1, semi-natural or just forcing
      3om = GF, 5+ minor, Hx major support, e.g. Axx Kx xxx KQ10xx
      3H = invitational, support (better than HCR, but flattish)
      3N = ~13--15 balanced
      4x = 3 card support splinter
    2H = 8--11, main suit nothing special
        2N = natural, invitational
        cue = F1, with Hx major support
    2N = (optional) F1, 10+ shapely, e.g. 6 card main suit and 4 card side suit, forcing to 3H
    3x = 8--11, 5--5  (not good enough for unusual 2N)
    3H = 8--11, excellent 6+ cards main suit (not mandatory with minimum)

* Einar Cue Bid

** Problem

Overcaller lacks a clear rebid when advancer bids a (forcing) new suit and both opener + responder are quiet. The
difficulty is mainly due to the wide ranging strength of overcalls, particularly over a forcing 1HS response. Examples:

- (1C)--1D--(P)--1H/1S--(P)
- (1C)--1H--(P)--1S--(P)
- (1D)--1H--(P)--1S--(P)
- (1H)--1S--(P)--2D--(P)
- (1H)--2C--(P)--2D--(P)
- (1S)--2D--(P)--2D--(P)

Typical hands that are hard to rebid:

- around 12(13) hcp and 3 card support, perhaps too good for a single raise
- minimum 8--11 without a natural rebid (advancer's 1H/1S is forcing one round), without 6 carder, no 3 card support,
  usually 5--3--3--2
- ~(13)14--16(17) hcp with a need to general force

** Solution

- cue bid of opener's suit in any auction where opener and responder both pass after the initial opening bid can be used
  as a catchall bid (instead of the usual assumption that it's to show a good raise), but
- only when the cue bid allows advancer to rebid their 2HS major or 3CD minor (so not forced to bid too high).

Note, a simpler version is to use it only when the advancer bids 1H or 1S, e.g.
(1C)--1D--(P)--1S--(P)--cue.

(1D)--1H--(P)--1S--(P)
  1N = ~10--13, stop
  2C = natural, 4!cs, minimum ~8--11
  2D = Einar catchall cue bid (not just the best !s raise)
    2H = minimum, usually doubleton support, ~8--13
      P = minimum ~8--12 without support
      2S = middling 3 card !s raise, ~12--13 hcp
      2N = max, flat with stopper ~14 hcp
      3H = 6 card maximum0
      3S = good 3 card !s raise, ~14--15 hcp (bid immediate 2N with 4 card support)
    2S = ~8--11, prefers !ss, maybe only 5 cards with !h shortage
    2N = natural invitational ~13--14 hcp, !d stop
    3C = forcing, mostly natural
    3D = stop ask, extras
    3H = invite
  2H = natural 6 carder, usually ~10--12 hcp (would use weak two with less)
  2S = minimum, 3 card support
  2N = (when jump 2N free) artificial, max with good support, or 6!hs + 4 lower rank suit
    3C = artificial ask
      3D = !ds
      3H = !cs
      3S = max with 4 card !s support
  3C = natural, ~12--13, good suits (use cue if stronger, unusual NT if 5--5)
  3D = splinter, !s support, ~12--13, invitational
  3H = ~11--13 long !hs distributional invite
  3S = ~12--13 constructive (not a live auction), 4 card invite


* 1CD Opening Interference Handling

** Problem

A minor opening doesn't promise much length in the case of !cs and only 4 !ds. Often these hands are balanced. When the
opponents overcall our 1C/1D opening the 4th hand may be about to raise or make our lives difficult in some other way.
Especially over a 1C opening it's not clear that we should just be raising !cs, rather we probably want to bid
constructively.

** Solution

There's only tradeoffs here and some rarely played. Many will want to play 1N by responder as a natural bid. This has
positional advantage - often both sides may want to play 1N and declarer usually has the advantage. After a 1H overcall
we could use 1S as a transfer, but we wouldn't have that if there was a 1S overcall. Showing a constructive 8+ hcp 6
card major immediately will help in the case of further interference, so here's a structure that mainly focuses on that
plus some 5--5 two suiters without too many lower level transfers:

1C--(1D)
  X = negative, majors
  1N = natural
  2D = !h transfer, 8+ hcp, 6+ cards
  2H = !s transfer, 8+ hcp, 6+ cards
  2S = artificial, replaces cue bid showing good raise
  2N = artificial, 10+ hcp, 5--5+ majors
  3D = artificial, 10+ hcp, 5 major + 5+ !cs

The tradeoff here is that you maybe unsure what to bid with a normal invitational NT hand. If you do play the artificial
2N bid however, you have gained a way to quickly show a powerful offensive hand before there is further bidding. If
playing 2N as natural perhaps play 3D as both majors.

1CD--(1H)
  2H = !s transfer, 8+ hcp, 6+ cards
  2S = artificial, replaces cue bid showing good raise
  2N = artificial, 10+ hcp, 5--5+ unbid suits
  3om = (other minor) artificial, 10+ hcp, 5+!ss + 5+ minor support

1CD--(1S)
  X = negative
  2om = (other minor) !h transfer
  2H = artificial, 10+ hcp, unbid minor, forcing to 3om
  2S = artificial, replaces cue bid showing good raise
  2N = artificial, 10+ hcp, 5--5+ unbid suits
  3om = (other minor) artificial, 10+ hcp, 5+!ss + 5+ minor support

Notice another oddity here, the other minor showing !hs. You can play this as showing a 6 card suit or even 5+ cards.
That depends on how many !hs you may have for your negative double and how strong it is. It's normal after a !s overcall
to communicate strength with 5+ !hs in one bid and weakness with variable length by the double. You can also play the !h
transfer as weak or GF then just double with a 6!h invite, with the downside that the double is very unclear on the
length until responder can bid again.

1CD--(1N)
  X = values/penalty
  2C = majors
  2DH = transfers
  2S = artificial, good other minor (but not values / willingness to double)
  2N = artificial, good minor raise
  3m = preemptive raise

We could just play our normal defence to a 1N opening in this auction. Given that partner has opened however, it may
help if we put the strong overcalller on lead and make the opening bidder play the contract. The minor raise is
obviously more useful after a 1D opening.

1D--(2C)
  X = negative, majors or catchall game force
  2DH = transfers, 5+ cards
  2S = 5--5+ majors, 8+ hcp
  2N = natural
  3C = artificial, invitational plus !d raise

In this specific auction some might just play their 1N system responses and double 2C for Stayman. This is not much
different except we've made an effort to show the powerful 5--5 majors hand in one bid.

1CD--(2x) jump bid
  X = takeout
  2HS = natural, 10+ forcing
  3under = (1 under the opponent's suit) shortage, GF values
  2N-3H = transfers 5+ suit (6 card if can bid natural 2H/2S)
  3S = artificial GF with minor support


* 2C Opening Responses with Kokish

The 2C opening is not a good point of "natural" bidding systems because the opening bid takes a fair amount of space
without saying anything about shape. Ideally responder only takes up bidding space if they have something quite specific
to say and it may help lead to a slam. The stranger jump responses here are to help judge cheap slams. The higher the
jump, which takes up more space, the more specific the bid's meaning.

The (optional) Kokish relay convention (2!c--2!d--2!h artificial) saves space on some bids, after which a partnership
may take advantage of the extra space and make their 2NT opening bid 20--21 hcp, which is more tightly defined and
easier to respond to. At that point the other bids all become 1 hcp less:

- 2N = 20--21
- 2C--2D--2N = 22--23
- 2C--2D--2H--2S--2N = 24--25
- 2C--2D--3N = 26--27
- 2C--2D--2H--2S--3N = 28--29
- 2C--2D--4N = 30--31

Note, even if you do not play the Kokish relay, playing the 2N opening bid as 20--21 and 2C--2D--2N as 22--23 is
helpful. A balanced hand with 24 hcp usually wants to go to game and any 26+ hcp hand is extremely rare.

- the suggested simple responses are not that much different to the base bidding system, just trying to be more specific
- the artificial double negative is the cheapest 3C/3D minor bid over 2HS rebids only (instead of 2N in the base
  system). 2N is then waiting or a substitute bid for the cheapest minor. You may decide not to change this, but know
  the purpose is to make the strong opener play 3N more often - a common contract after a negative response without a
  good 6+ suit
- 2C--2D--3C shows another artificial (optional) follow on, 3D as waiting to let opener bid a 4 card major

2C = artificial strong
    2D = relay, waiting saving space or actual boring hand
        2H = artificial "Kokish" relay, either game forcing !hs OR a stronger NT rebid
            2S = relay, artificial, forced to bid
                2N = 25--26 hcp balanced (now 2!c--2!d--3N is 27--28 hcp)
                3CDS = natural 5!hs and 4+ natural side suit
                3H = natural 6+ cards !hs GF, not good enough for 2C--2D--3H
                3N = 29--30 hcp
        2H = (without Kokish)
            2S = 5+ suit natural
            2N = waiting or !cs
            3C = artificial cheapest minor negative, no control points, ~0--3 hcp
        2S = as normal
            2N = waiting or !cs, not negative
            3C = artificial cheapest minor negative, no control points, ~0--3 hcp
        3C = as normal
            3D = artificial, waiting, in case opener has a 4+ card major
        3D = as normal
            3HS = as normal, 5+ card suit - no room for anything fancy!
    2HS = some slam prospect with support from opener, e.g. 5 carder 3 honours + side control or 6 carder 2 honours + side control
    3CD = single suiter hand, 2+ "control points" (at least 2 kings or 1 ace), e.g. KQJxx + side K, KJ10xxx + side K
    3HS = semi-solid suit + side control, KQJ10xx, KQJxxxx, AQJ10xx etc, unlike the 2HS response these suits play well v.s. a doubleton or singleton honour
    3N = (more advanced) any solid (AKQ+) 6/7 card suit (it's assumed opener can spot which suit they have!), setting trumps
        4CDHS = control bids
        4N = keycard blackwood for the solid suit
    4C = (more advanced) !d *transfer* with exactly 3 honours, 7 cards, no other controls
        4D = bid as asked
        4N = keycard blackwood for !ds
        other = own excellent suit, to play
    4D = (more advanced) !h *transfer* with exactly 3 honours, 7 cards, no other controls
        4H = bid as asked
        4N = keycard blackwood for !hs
        other = own excellent suit, to play
    4H = (more advanced) !s *transfer* with exactly 3 honours, 7 cards, no other controls
        pass = !h suit excellent, to play
        4S = bid as asked
        4N = keycard blackwood for !ss
        other = own excellent suit, to play
    4S = (more advanced) !c *transfer* with exactly 3 honours, 7 cards, no other controls
        pass = !s suit excellent, to play
        4N = keycard blackwood for !cs
        5C = bid as asked
        other = own excellent suit, to play

* Preempt Roman Keycard

For cheaper slam hunting preempt keycard blackwood can help and keep the partnership at the natural game level.

This is a form of keycard blackwood that asks for keycards (Aces or the King of trumps) that a weak preempt bidder
responds to. As their hand is weak, they cannot have many keycards so the response are different to the usual 1430
keycard blackwood system. Additionally, the asking bid is 4C (or 4!d after a 3!c preempt) so we can stop at
the game level instead of going to the 5 level as we would after using 4NT as keycard blackwood

Step responses (1st step, 2nd step etc):

- 0 keycards
- 1 keycard
- 1 keycard + Queen of trumps
- 2 keycards
- 2 keycards + Queen of trumps

E.g. 2S--4C preempt keycard blackwood then:

- 4D = 0 keycards
- 4H = 1 keycard etc.

Obvious situations you can agree to play it are weak twos, weaks threes and 4C openings:

- 2D--4C
- 2H--4C
- 2S--4C
- 3C--4D
- 3D--4C
- 3H--4C
- 3S--4C
- 4C--4D

You include other situations where your bid is by agreement a weak two / weak three / 4C, i.e. jump overcalls
after which you are responding as though it's a weak opening.

* Reversed Lebensohl

** Problem

Yet another Lebensohl like situation where we want to distinguish different hand strengths / shapes / stops when the
opponents are interfering at the 2 level.

- with the earlier [Transfer Lebensohl](#Transfer Lebensohl Over 2 Level Interference) our partner is usually balanced
  and we may pass
- with [Better Minor Lebensohl](#Lebensohl - Defending Weak 2HS) we are FORCED to bid over partner's takeout double of a
  weak two (and 3rd hand, the weak two bidder's partner has passed)

Transfers make less sense when partner is unbalanced (the auction can be more cooperative / two-way), although right
siding the contract still has merit. When the auction is already live with two bids from the opposition, we need to show
shape or NT feature immediately - if we try to bid 2N to distinguish weak vs invite vs possibly some GF hands then we
might be preempted out the bidding.

** Solution

Reversed Lebensohl can be better where partner is expected to be UNBALANCED and we are allowed to pass, bidding is
optional. The most obvious situations are (1!d)--X--(2!d) or (1M)--X--(2M). These are live auctions, the opener could raise
the bidding further giving us little space to bid constructively.

With Reversed Lebensohl 2N puts focus on finding a NT contract, promises some sort of stop(s) and is at least invitational.
Responses to 2N are similar to Better Minor Lebensohl.

The 3x new suit bids are weak / competitive with no way to show invitational strength, i.e ~0--9(10) hcp. You must choose
between a game punt or competing (which is similar to the Better Minor Gucci Lebensohl 3!c bid). The motivation is to
get into the auction before opener shuts us out. We might compete and reopen double with a max 9/10 hcp. Despite 3x
being competitive by default, if your suit is available to bid at the 2 level, e.g. (1!h)--X--(2!h)--2S then a jump 3x is
still free to use as an invite

Note, the name "reversed" doesn't really help, as other variations of Lebensohl might be called "Reverse" Lebensohl
(without the 'd'). This variant is "Reversed" compared to standard Lebensohl in that it does not focus on splitting up
strength ranges weak/invite/GF with 2N but instead focusses on stops.

* 1M--(2C)--2D as Major Transfer

** Problem

Overcalls in general, and to some extent the lack of bidding space after a 1H/1S opening to show a competitive suit
with less than invitational values. In some ways this is a follow on from [1CD Opening Interference Handling](#1CD Opening Interference Handling),
but now we have opened a major.

** Solution

One solution that we give only a small recommendation for is "negative free bids". These are new suit free bids
that show up to a bad invite, e.g. ~5--10 hcp and a good 5 card or 6+ card suit. These could be played up to the level
of 3D or perhaps just 2S. These bids are non-forcing and alertable. The affect on your system is that you should then
play a jump new suit as a good 6+ card GF hand, which means that some fit jumps are not available and a 1 under jump as
a mixed raise (if you play those) is also not available (so the jump raise should be a mixed raise in that case). Those
changes may not be too problematic as fit jumps are quite rare and maybe usable at a higher level. The biggest issue
is that you have to double with various invite plus hands that are not good enough for jump new suit. After a double the
opponents can raise the bidding and it becomes difficult to sort out your hand, e.g 1D--(1!s)--X--(3!s) is difficult to
deal with.

Transfers are usually the way to get the benefits of being constructive and competitive at the same time. However, after
a 1H/1S opening there's not much room to play many transfers (unlike what can possibly be done after we open a minor
and the opponents overcall a major). Really we are only left with one type of auction where we can show a negative free
bid like hand or bid constructively:

1H--(2C)
  2D = !s transfer
  2H = minimum !h raise
  2S = !ds, constructive 3 level values

1S--(2C)
  2D = !h transfer
  2H = !ds, constructive 3 level values
  2S = minimum !s raise

This is useful, but one specific situation to remember. With negative free bids we would have more options --
1H--(1S)--2C/2D competitive, 1H/1S--(2C)--2D competitive, 1H--(2D)--2S etc. but have the downsides of negative free bids
to deal with.

* Transfer Walsh Over 1C Opening

** Problem

After a 1C opening (short, 2+ !cs in the base system) we would often like opener to play the hand as they are commonly
the stronger hand. With the limited bidding space it's quite possible to miss a 3--5 major fit when opener rebids 1NT
and responder does not feel they have a suitable hand to potentially play a 5--2 fit at the 2 level instead of 1N. If we
play 2N as a natural invitational response, can we invite to game at the one level instead? Going 1 off in 2N is not
rare. Perhaps we can rebid 1N with stronger NT hands, saving space and making a 14--16 NT opening less likely to bid 2N
with just 17 hcp.

** Solution

Some transfers, in particular to the majors showing 4+ cards. Bidding is mostly natural, so not that hard to learn. The
auction is frequent enough to be very useful. What completing or breaking the transfer means depends on your choice.
Transfer Walsh could perhaps be further up the list of things to try, but there's no standard way to play it and it can
have notable knock on affects to a few other bidding sequences. Some response styles are complicated, but the basics are
easy to pick up.

Note, called transfer Walsh because it's played with Walsh style bids of the shorter major before minor with weaker
hands (less than invite/GF values). Continuations can make use of things like [two-way NMF](#Two-Way New Minor Forcing xyNT),
as you might without transfers, or various other ideas, partnership choice. It's unlikely to be played with a better
minor opening system - you will want to take advantage of it by opening 1C more often than 1D. Opening 1C with short !cs
and 4!ds is the usual style trying to take advantage of the extra space. Some systems go as far as making both the 1C
and 1D opening 2+ cards (a 5--5--2--2 opening system) so that starting via 1C or 1D then a 1N rebid can show different
strengths, which may help if trying to pack something like a mini NT into your NT ladder.

Downsides? As with any transfer the opposition can double the artificial suit, in this case to say they would have
overcalled it or perhaps just for lead direction. You will have to clarify your follow on bids and how it may change
other bidding system sequences. There's arguably too much choice.

A small change is:

1C
  1D = 4+ !hs
    1H = 3!hs, minimum opening (perhaps include 4 card major)
      1N = 4!hs, natural
    1N = 12--14 balanced, without 3!hs
    2H = 4+!hs, natural
  1H = 4+ !ss
    1S = 3!ss, minimum opening
      1N = 4!ss, natural
    1N = 12--14 balanced, without 3!hs
    2S = 4+ !ss, natural
  1S = !ds
  1N = natural, no change

We get the basic benefit of knowing whether we can play a 5--3 fit immediately. A tweak is to play the transfer
completion to include a minimum 4 card support and then the 2M/3M raises are a bit stronger (3M perhaps GF). Opener will
correct to the major contract to clarify the length next time.

A second approach:

1C
  1D = 4+ !hs
    1H = 12--14 with 2 or 3!hs
      P = 5+ cards weak
      1N = only 4 !hs, natural
    1N = strong 18--19 balanced
    2H = 4+ !hs, minimum opening, no extras promised
  1H = 4+ !ss
    1S = 12--14 with 2 or 3!ss
      P = 5+ cards weak
      1N = only 4 !ss, natural
    1N = strong 18--19 balanced
    2S = 4+ !ss, minimum opening, no extras promised

Here we can try to play any 5--2 major fit at the one level, which is often going to make. Indeed with some suggested
[1N stayman response](#1NT Responses, Smolen and Others) changes we may often play 2S in a 5--2 fit (but with
invitational hands). Note, after the strong 1N rebid it will be more comfortable showing a 5 card major at the 2 level.
Additionally, a jump 2N rebid can be used for something else -- one thought being an awkward 17+ hcp hand with a long 6+
card !c suit and 3 card major support (similar to a [jump reverse](#Jump Reverses)).

As mentioned, if you can rebid 1N with (17)18--19 balanced you might look at the [NT ranges](#NT Ranges) and try a
14--16 1N opening, but this is a big change. Do you want to open 1C with short !cs and 4!ds? The strong 1N rebid will
always help with light 1 level responses not forcing the auction too high, so there is incentive to hide the natural !ds
with a balanced hand. This comes with the downside of missing fits when the opponents compete.

Note, in both of the above styles responder can still end up playing 1N, so it doesn't transfer every contract.

Now, even if we have decided on our 1N rebid style, there are still some different things to do
with the 1S and 1N responses (so many different options, only some are shown below). An easy approach:

1C
  1D = 4+ !hs
  1H = 4+ !ss
  1S = !ds OR 6--9 1N bid
    1N = 12--14 balanced
    2N = 18--19 balanced
  1N = 10--11 NT bid
  2N = 12--13 balanced

Depending on your opening aggression the 2N response could be played as forcing, or 2N can be 12--13 hcp - enough
usually to be safe in 2N. The added accuracy on the NT ranges initially makes it unclear whether we really have any !ds.

After interference, you can play double of 1D or 1H as I would have bid that, a Stolen double.

The above are the more basic options, and what you can experiment with initially. There are many more that you could
research. A couple of more complicated examples:

1C
  1D = 4+ !hs
    1H = ...
      2H = 6 !hs
  1H = 4+ !ss
    1S = ...
      2S = 6 !ss
  1S = NT relay, unknown strength
    1N = transfer completion
      2C = stayman
      2x = invitational, 5 cards
  1N = forcing 4--4 majors

1C
  1D = 4+ !hs (maybe weak 4--4 majors)
    1H = 12--14, 2 or 3 !hs
      P = 5+ cards weak
      1S = artificial NT transfer (opener can play the contract)
      1N = artificial, 4!ss (opener can play the contract)
      2C = weak, to play
      2D = artificial, retransfer, invitational 5 !hs
        2H = to play
        2N = minimum, 2 !hs (could agree to bid 2H with Hx support etc.)
      2H = 6 !hs, invitational ~9--12
    1N = 18--19, 2 or 3 !hs
      others = normal NT system on

      2H = artificial, retransfer, invitational 5 !ss

  2D = artificial 5--5 majors
  2HS = weak jump shifts, up to 8 hcp
  2N = artificial 5--5 minors
  3C = usual preempt or mixed raise
  3D = weak preempt (splinter less helpful over short !c)


This shows some extra details a partnership may agree. The NT relay helps opener play the hand more often, but doesn't
allow showing e.g a 10--11 hcp response at the 1 level.


* 3C--3D Response

Over a 3C opening there is room with an artificial 3D to fish for a 5--3 major fit or alternatively show a variety of
hands including invite with a major. If bidding a 5 card major instead of 3N then you probably have a good enough suit
to play 4M with just Hx support, so the second option is probably better.


3C
    3D = promises a 5 card major, asking for 3 cards
        3H = !h shortage, offering 3 card !s support (so stronger hand can play)
        3S = !s shortage, offering 3 card !h support (so stronger hand can play)
        3N = no 3 card major
        4D = !d void, both majors 3-–3-–0-–7
        4H = !d singleton, both majors 3–-3–-1-–6
    3HS = natural, maybe only 5 cards (6+ cards if playing the 3!d advanced agreement)

3C
    3D = artificial, 6+ good major invite OR GF strong !ds OR !c invite OR tight 3N Hx !cs
        3H = pass if !hs, might accept !ss
            P = !h invite hand
            3S = !s invite
            3N = Hx !cs, requires good !cs to play 3N
            4C = natural invite
            4D = GF natural long !ds
        3S = pass if !ss, accepts !hs
            P = !s invite hand
            3N = Hx !cs, requires good !cs to play 3N
            4C = natural invite
            4D = GF natural long !ds
            4H = to play, !h invite hand
        3N = accepts either major
            4C = natural invite
            4D = GF natural long !ds
            4M = to play

* Gazilli - Rebidding Good Hands

** Problem

The 1 level opening strength in most natural bidding systems is very wide, e.g. roughly 11 (rule of 20) to 21 hcp.
Opener's rebid often has problems showing offensive distributional hands which may have a lot of tricks but not so many
points. When we have established a fit we may add extra support/distributional points for our shortages and with a 9
card fit be very content going to a major game on 22/23 hcp. However, we can't just upgrade our hands without a fit
unless our suit is good enough to play well versus most hands that partner may hold.

Consider that 1H--1S--2D is a wide ranging rebid, roughly 11--17 hcp. You need approximately 18+ hcp to jump rebid 3D
which is game forcing. A 5--5 two suiter or even a 6--5 two suiter may have a lot of playing strength. It would be nice
if we could tell partner about such hands on our rebid and show that we have roughly 14--16 hcp (not minimum, not
strong) and a good two suiter that is not strong enough to force to game.

It's not just two suiters, sometimes you have a long suit without the values for a jump rebid, but something beyond a
minimum. With AK10xxx x KJ10 QJx and the auction 1S--1N it's unclear if we'd want to jump rebid 3S, yet the 6 card suit
with 2 top honours and a side singleton is much better than many minimums. Take away the singleton and 3S is looking a
very dubious rebid, but there is potential for quite a few tricks with those 2 top honours.

Finally, some opening hands are awkwardly too strong after a 1 level response. For example, with 19 hcp, AQ10xxx in your
suit and 3 card support for your partner's 1S response there is no great rebid. You cannot raise partner's major
with 3 card support to game (they may only have 4 cards) or splinter. 3N maybe the common and best contract, but perhaps you have
one very weak suit. You are too strong to just jump rebid your minor at the 3 level. If partner has a good 5 or 6 card
major you may want to look for slam or just play game in a 5--3 fit. You maybe able to lie in order to create a force
(e.g. 1!c--1!s--2!d or 1!d--1!s--2!h, but what about after 1!d--1!h?) with a reverse on a 2 or 3 card suit, but also
create confusion.

** Solution

Gazilli is a conventional forcing 2C rebid by a 1H or 1S opener that helps split your hand strength.

- 1H--1N--2C
- 1S--1N--2C
- 1H--1S--2C  (optional, by extra agreement)
- 1D--1M--2C  (optional, even rarer, by extra agreement)

Gazilli has many small variations that advanced partnerships may like to investigate, each with their own small
differences in costs and benefits. In this variant the 2C rebid shows one of:

- roughly 17+ hcp strong hand
- minimum 6 card major rebid, ~11--13 hcp

You could play 16+ hcp for the strong range depending on your style and opening aggression. The strong bid is used for
all 17+ hands except for a 1H--1N--2S reverse being a strong 16+ hand with 6+ !hs (showing !ss via 2!c means 5!hs only).

** Many Ways to Use a Weak Only Multi 2D Opening

Regular practiced partnerships may enjoy playing a Multi 2D. A Multi 2D is an opening bid that has multiple possible
meanings. No one except opener knows at the start. A weak only multi 2D opening bid shows one of:

- weak two in !hs
- weak two in !ss

Now you can do something else with your 2H and 2S opening bids, perhaps one of:

- show a weak two in !hs and !ss, but with different point range
- show a weak two in !hs and !ss, but with different suit length

The Multi 2D gives us an extra bid to help us preempt more without making partner's life difficult when it comes to
constructive bidding. Defending the 2D bid can be difficult.

On the downside, some partnerships may include constructive strong hands in the Multi 2D opening bid (not a weak only bid
then), which adds more complexity and won't be looked at here. Adding constructive bids reduces the pressure of the 2D
bid (a weak only multi could be passed by responder with long !ds).

Additionally, beware that the weak only Multi 2D might not be allowed in lower level bridge competitions (it can be hard to defend against without practice)

Some example opening combinations using the Multi 2D follows below. In each case we are only talking about the 1st/2nd position opening bids.

In 3rd position keep using a 2D, 2H and 2S opening as a natural weak two !ds/!hs/!s with a wide range aggressive style!


*** different major preempt strengths

- 2D = multi with weak two !hs OR weak two !ss, 4--7 hcp, 6 cards
- 2H = weak two !hs, 8--11 hcp, 6 cards
- 2S = weak two !ss, 8--11 hcp, 6 cards

You could flip the strengths (2!d 8--11), but 8--11 is more frequent and it's good to take up more bidding space with
this more common hand.

*** different major lengths

- 2D = multi with weak two !hs OR weak two !ss, ~7--10 hcp, 6 card major
- 2H = weak two !hs, ~7--10 hcp, 5 card major
- 2S = weak two !ss, ~7--10 hcp, 5 card major

You can flip the lengths (2!d 5 cards), but the 5 card suit is your more frequent hand and bidding quickly with the
shorter suit gives you less time to get into trouble.

Implicitly, there is always a 4+ card minor to go along with the 5 card major opening (we don't open balanced hands or
with a 4 card other major). You can play the 5 card 2HS opening when vulnerable if you think the hand is good enough,
e.g. 5--4--3--1 maximum with good suit or a 5--5 hand.

*** different major strengths with mixed 5 or 6 cards

- 2D = multi with weak two !hs OR weak two !ss, 4--7 hcp, 6 cards always
- 2H = weak two !hs, 8--11 hcp, 6 cards vulnerable, maybe 5 cards non-vulnerable
- 2S = weak two !ss, 8--11 hcp, 6 cards vulnerable, maybe 5 cards non-vulnerable

As the Multi 2D is hard to respond constructively to, we restrict the Multi 2D opening to a 6 card only suit. You may
decide to make the 2D opening mixed when non-vulnerable aswell if you like the adventure.

*** Playing the Weak Only Multi in 3rd Position?

This can be done instead of playing a 2D opening in 3rd position as a weak two with !ds. However, as everyone has a good
idea that the 4th hand will have most of the values, and probably won't struggle to find a bid, it maybe better to bid
!ds naturally and hope partner can raise the bidding quickly. A !d preempt is often more annoying to bid over than a 2!h
opening because the opponents often need to sort out the lengths of two major suits.

A name given to a 5 card major weak two (never 6 cards) that includes a 4 card minor. You may end up playing this if
your Multi 2D shows a 6 card weak two.

  3M = preemptive
  4CD = splinter
  4HS = to play


** Other Esoteric Preempts?

There are plenty of other weird and wonderful weak two level preemptive bids, but there are reasons they are not more
popular!

*** 2D both majors or 2H both majors

This bid can be played to various levels of aggression depending on partnership style and vulnerability. Maybe only play
it non-vulnerable.

- 3--11 hcp, 4--4+ both majors (hyper aggressive, very unconstructive)
- 5--10 hcp, 4--4+ both majors (very aggressive and hard to bid constructively over)
- 7--10 hcp, 5--4+ both majors (less frequent, more constructive, still unsure of which major is longest)
- 6--9 hcp, 5--5+ both majors (infrequent, but much clearer and safer bid)

This bid comes from the assumed fit philosophy of preempts - you show two suits, and even without much length (i.e 4--4)
there is a 60% chance partner has 4 card support for one of those suits.

This can be very dangerous when vulnerable, at any scoring, but especially at teams / IMPs. When non-vulnerable at
matchpoints it can be very disruptive, but there can still be many hands where it's hard to choose a game v.s. part
score contract if the point range and shape is too wide open!

If you do play it more constructively, e.g. 5--4+ shape both majors and ~7--10 hcp then you will find the bid doesn't
come up as frequently as you may like - it maybe better to use the bid for something else. Perhaps you should only play
it aggressively with a 4--4+ style.

Should we use 2D or 2H to show the major two suiter? 2H puts more pressure on the opponents to bid as partner can just
immediately pass. Now you've lost your natural weak two 2H opening preempt. However, many will say that the 2H opening
is the least effective weak two - 2S takes up all the space, whereas over 2D the opponents have to worry about both of
the majors. A 2H preempt points the opposition to thinking about !ss.

2H = both majors, weak
    2S = to play
    2N = asking bid
        3C = minimum, only not GF bid
            3D = asking bid
                3H = 4!s--5!h
                3S = 5!s--4!h
                3N = 4!s--4!h
            3HS = invite
        3D = 5--5 any range, GF
            3M = forcing, slam interest, suit picked
        3H = 5!h--4!s, maximum, GF
        3S = 5!s--4!h, maximum, GF
        3N = 4!s--4!h, maximum, GF
    3C = NF, escape
    3D = artificial invite, both majors 3--3 in !s!h
    3HS = obstructive
    4CD = splinter


*** 2N showing both minors

Yes, annoy the opponents when you have both minors - which hopefully means they have both majors and they now need to
bid at the 3 level to show them!

Your probably want ~9--12 hcp (which at least is more frequent than e.g. 5--9) to do this bid or extra shape (6--5
minors), with most of your points in your minors, because you are making your partner choose a minor at the 3 level.
Bidding at the 3 level is especially dangerous when vulnerable as you may only have a 7 or 8 card fit!

It's unlikely you will ever try to play in 2NT when the opponents have a good hand. The opponents know exactly which
two suits you have, so with a little practice it's not hard to defend this bid, for example:

(2N) both minors
    P = maybe weakish majors takeout or major overcall (you usually get another bid!)
    X = strong balanced or 18+ strong major
    3C = 5+!hs, 4+!ss, sound values
        3HS = preference
            4H = 6!h + 4!s, GF
    3D = 5+!ss, 4+!hs, sound values
    3HS = sound overcall
    4C = majors two suiter, strong

If that doesn't convince you that 2N both minors is not a great idea, then consider how you will bid your 20--21
balanced NT hand. There is a lot of value in having a bid to show a balanced hand with a specific point range (despite
2N sometimes preempting ourselves, making slam hard to bid). Additionally, even though it's a lot of points, it's
actually more frequent than picking up a 5--5+ minor hand.

*** Lucas Twos

This is the name given to a 5 card weak two that includes any 4 card side suit (not just a minor which would be a Dutch
two). Bidding with a possible side 4+ card major in 1st/2nd will preempt your own partnership in many deals. Maybe
that's your style when NV in 1st, not 2nd position. In 3rd position we are already happy bidding these hands. Note, it's
less of a problem with 6--4 hands if the opening 6 card suit is strong enough to play well opposite a singleton.



* 4NT Opening

This is very rare, so it's more for curiosity and advanced partnerships!

If you sat down with a random partner and they open 4N you might either guess that it's the Blackwood convention
asking for the Ace count (the first slam convention many people learn) or you would assume it's the more common
"specific ace ask" where responder just bids an Ace they have, 5!c with no ace, 6!c with the !c ace and 5N if they
happen to have 2 aces.

This bid practically never happens and doesn't see any use over thousands of hands, so it's not surprising if it is

Two bids that are still very infrequent but much more common than a specific ace ask would be:

(1) 4N showing a 9 trick minor preempt (normally you open 5!c or 5!d). As it shows a slightly better than a normal 5C or
5D preempt it makes it easier for responder to raise to slam or not. You can play it as an 8(9) card solid suit or
semi-solid plus at least one side suit Ace. This is often a minimum opening hand, e.g. 10--13 hcp, but could be less
with enough shape

(2) both minors preempt 6--6 shape. A 6--5 minors preempt would be much more common, but skipping past 3N with a 6--5
minor hand is often a bad idea. As you are so high level there is also more risk of being doubled, so you need a fair
number of points, probably including a minium opening, e.g. 9--13 hcp. Really it needs to be a 6--6 shape hand, but this
hand is very rare roughly 1 in 8000 hands for specifically both minors.

For the above reasons of frequency the most useful suggestion is:

- 1st/2nd position 4N is the 9 trick minor preempt
- 3rd position 4N is a wide ranging aggressive 6--6 or some 6--5 minors hand, ~6--14 hcp. As partner has already passed
  you can afford skip past 3N and to bid more aggressively with some 6--5 hands when non-vulnerable, or even vulnerable
  with enough points. You are not trying to be constructive as partner has passed. Use your judgement on vulnerability, suit lengths and quality

4N = 1st/2nd position: 9 tricks minor preempt, 3rd position: both minors
    5CD = pass/correct v.s. single suiter, to play opposite both minors
    5HS = cue, looking for side control Ace knowing 4N bidder is semi-solid with side Ace
        5N = other major Ace
        6CD = natural, with other minor Ace
    6CD = pass/correct v.s. single suiter, to play opposite both minors (massive double fit preempt)
    7CD = pass/correct v.s. single suiter
