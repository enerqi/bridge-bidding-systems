#+DESCRIPTION: Everything about 2NT

* 2NT Opening

- 19--20 NT
- roughly same shape as [1NT Opening](#1NT Opening)
- unlikely to open a reasonable 5--4/6 card minor for fear of missing slam

Responding:

- one major: 3 level transfer, unless it's a slam try (Lissabon in that case)
- major + minor hand: 3 level transfer to major first
- 4--4 majors: muppet stayman
- 3 card major + NO 5 card major: muppet stayman option (NOT 4--3--3--3)
- 5!h + 4!s: transfer then bid 3N (so stronger hand can play 4!s), or artificial 4!c with a slam try
- 5!s--4!h: muppet stayman then 4H over 3!d response or artificial 4CD with slam try/slam force
- 5!h--5!s+ both majors: transfer to !h first, then 4CD are special artificial bids
- both minors: 3S
- 3 suiter: transfer to a 5 card major otherwise muppet stayman, then prefer show 5 card minor over 4--4 majors if slammish
- slam try single suiters: 4CDHS Lissabon, but maybe use 3DH transfer with self EKB hand

**** 2N--3C

- Muppet Stayman (modified puppet variant), with 3!d response being low information compared to normal puppet variants,
  similar to 4 card stayman
- Finds 5--3 or 4--4 major fits
- Includes responder having 5!ss--4!hs, (otherwise responder transfers with a 5 card major - 4!ss--5!hs or 5--5), with
  the 3N response helping such hands recognise there is no fit

3D = no 5 card major, 3+!ss or 4+!hs (fit exists opposite 5!ss + 4!hs)
    3H = artificial maybe 4!ss, maybe no 4 card major just wants to play 3N, not !hs, maybe minor slam try module

- maybe minor second suit, limited OR slam try+
- maybe both majors 5!h--4!s/5--5+, limited OR slam try+

- NOT BOTH Majors (5--4/ 4--5 / 5--5), 5!s + 4!h use muppet, 5--5 use !h transfer

**** Minor slam tries module

After muppet stayman and responder voluntarily continues over 3N, responder may have ONE OR BOTH minors (they may have
only 3 cards in a major, e.g. 3--1--5--4). Note 5--5 minors with a 3 card major is awkward, but should probably respond
2N--3S to show both minors.
