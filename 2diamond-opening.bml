#+TITLE: Natural intermediate 2D Opening

* 2D Intermediate Opening

- (10)11--15 hcp, 6+ card !d suit
- good 10 hcp only, working honours
- 3rd rarely a point lighter, weigh against a [3!d opening](#3CD Openings) and constructive bidding
- Not 6(7)!d + 5!h/!s, open 1!d (with extras) or 1!h/!s (with minimum) instead
- 7!d/8!d--4!c/!d/!h are fine, though may use preempts in 3rd
- 6--6 minors are very infrequent, open as seems best. A [2!c Opener](#2C Intermediate Opening) maybe the
  best compromise between constructive space and preemptive.

Responding:

There are space limitations compared to the [2!c Opener](#2C Intermediate Opening) and so fewer constructive options.

- 2!h/2!s responses are forcing, invite plus, so there is no NF signoff at the 2 level
- 2!h/2!s can be used to look for a 4--4 fit
- Bid 2!h with 4--4 majors or 5--5 majors
- 2N !d support covers various hands from miminal !d support looking for 3N, to good !d support or even a !d slam try
- 2N can quantify opener's strength before stopper/control bids, whilst a 3!d slam try asks for shortages specifically before RKB
- No weak !cs sign off bid available
- No special bids for 6+!cs + 5!h/!ss nor a dedicated 5--5 majors invite, so GF hands bid 3x naturally instead of going by an enquiry
