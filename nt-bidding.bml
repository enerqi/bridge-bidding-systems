#+DESCRIPTION: One Notrump openings, responses, defences, escapes etc.

* NT Ranges and Scheme Situations

- 1N = 16--18 hcp, maybe 5 card major or 5--4--2--2 long !c/!d.
- 2N = 19--20 hcp, maybe 5 card major or 5--4--2--2 long !c/!d.
- 1N balancing (1x)--P--(P)--1NT = ~11--14 hcp, balancing/protective
- X balancing then NT (1x)--P--(P)--X = ~15--17 hcp
- 2N balancing (1x)--P--(P)--2NT = 18--20 hcp, balancing/protective
- 1N overcall (1x)--1N = 15--18
- X then overcall (1x)--X then free NT bid = 18--20 hcp
- X then jump overcall (1x)--X ... jump NT = 21+ hcp
- (2x)--2N = 16--18

Blanket approaches to bidding when natural 1NT and 2NT bids made by our side.

- 1NT/2NT *opened*
- (2x)-2N

* 1NT Opening

Opening:

- 15/18 hcp hands can be promoted to 1N/2N.
- 16/19 hcp hands rarely demoted.
- 5--4--2--2 with a long minor can be opened with 1N
- 6--3--2--2 with a long minor can also by judgement open 1N (e.g. with poor suit quality)
- rare 4--4--4--1 singleton A/K

Responding:

- balanced invite: use 2!s range ask
- 5--4 majors weak: pass or *transfer* signoff
- weakish 3 suiter short !cs: 2!c possibly, but will play in 3HS if opener has both majors
- 4--4/5--4 majors invitational or GF: bid 2!c and then over 2!d bid 2!h/2!s or 3!h/3!s Smolen
- 5!hs invitational: transfer then artifical 2!s
- 5!ss invitational: 2!c Stayman then 2!s
- 5--5 majors invitational: !s transfer then bid 3!h
- 5--5 majors GF or slam try: 2!c then artificial 4!c/4!d over a 2!d response
- 6--4 majors GF: stayman then bid 4M (no transfer option) or just show the 6 card major
- 6--4 majors slam try: usually just show 6 card major otherwise no way to show 6 cards
- 4--3--3--3 hands with 4 card !h/!s often do better in NT
- 5--3--3--2 with major can use stayman then bid NT or Smolen, maybe only bidding 4HS with a 9 card fit
- 5 card minor + 3 card major 5--3--3--2 slam try: puppet stayman
- 5--4--(3--1) GF minor hands: 3DH responses allow stop investigation for 3N
- 5--4--(3--1) slam try minor hands: Stayman (NOT puppet stayman!)
- one 4 card major invitational: Stayman
- one 4 card major GF OR one/two 3 card major(s) when GF AND NOT 5--4--(3--1) minor hands (see 3DH): Puppet Stayman
- minor single suiter, any strength: 2!s/2N !c/!d transfers
- 6 card minor + 3 card major: choice of 2!s/2N !c/!d transfers or Puppet Stayman as guessed appropriate
- major + minor GF or slam try: start with major transfer (5+ cards) or stayman (4 cards), usually only slam try hands if show the minor
- major + minor invite: can only show the major
- minors GF plus hands only: 3!s
- major game or slightly preemptive: 4CD showing !h/!s with room to show a super fit (super fit is lots of Aces/Kings in side suits and maybe lower honours in partner's suit, or a picture raise in some situations)
- major slam try no void: 3DH transfers
- major slam try with void: 2DH transfers
- Note 4HS natural bids are not used in principle - 3DH can be major slam trys and 4CD transfers are used to play

*** 1N--2C

Stayman, promissory, maybe weakish 4--4--4--1!c

- Roughly invitational plus UNLESS weak 3 suiter with short !cs
- Always some major: one 4 card invitational exactly or 4--4 both majors invitational plus
- With both majors then the invite can be marginal, e.g. 6+ hcp
- NOT 5--5 majors precisely invitational - will transfer to !ss and then bid !hs
- GF and slam try 5--4 (Smolen) / 5--5 major hands do start with Stayman

- either: 6--4 (make it up with 6--4 shape)
- 2N: 5--4--2--2, poorer suit quality
- 3CD: 5--4--2--2, concentrated good suit quality

Responder's 2N vs 3N 5--3--3--2 rebid preferences after transfer:

- 2N: slam interest, 5--3--3--2

* 1NT Interference and Lebensohl

Lebensohl variations are played in a number of blanket NT and other places where the idea is relevant.
Most important is its use against weak twos and after we have made natural opening strength
(or better) 1NT bid / overcall.

- 1NT--(Overcall)  (but not 2!c as just ignore)
- (1X)--1NT Overcall by us including Protective--(bid over)
- 1C--(2!d!h!s)
- 1C--1D--(2!d!h!s)--X
- 1D--(2!h!s)
- (1C prepared)--2C natural
- (1D prepared)--2D natural
- (1H)--X--(2H)
- (1S)--X--(2S)
- balancing or reopening doubles forcing partner to bid
- (Weak 2!d!h!s)--X
- (1NT weak)--X--(XX Escape)
- (1NT weak)--X--(2D+ Escape) (but not 2!c escape as just ignore)
- (1NT weak)--P--(2x)--X
- (2D multi)--X

Our (1) main variant ([note: Lebensohl variants](#Lebensohl Variants)) is a form of transfer Lebensohl.
There are other variants that are used in specific situations - (2) when FORCED to bid over a major preempt and
(3) partner is likely unbalanced and we may pass or double, so NOT forced to bid

The custom structure to the (1) main transfer Lebensohl variant is:

- 2suit bids are natural weak/competitive
- 2N multi-way puppet to !cs either weak/competitive !c/!d hands or GF !cs
- 3!c/3!d/3!h transfers to new suits are invitational plus - opener with fit/good hand bids on
- transfer around/through the cue suit
- Cue is GF staymanic, at least 3 other major, and if double also available it shows a singleton/void in opponents' suit
- Cue implies NO stop, i.e. cue showing a singleton, but also after a double
- X is staymanic not suitable for staymanic cue bid  (of a natural suit implied but maybe not bid)
- X negative then 3N shows the other major and a stopper
- X negative then cue bid shows the other major and NO stopper
- X then new suit is invitational, exactly 5 cards (probably poor suit as not transferred)
- 3!h over opponents 2!s is weak/competitive
- 3N is to play, stop

For variant (2) when we are FORCED to bid OVER a MAJOR preempt, then there is [Better Minor Lebensohl](#Better Minor Lebensohl over a major preempt takeout double).

The variant (3) [RLEB](#Reversed Lebensohl RLEB) is typically (1M)--X--(2M), but could be (2D multi)--X--(2M) or
(1m)--2m, where we can pass, maybe double (responsive / flattish), show NT interest plus stop with invite plus values
immediately or the final option is to bid a suit without any invitational nuance before opener gets in the way again
(decide to punt game or just compete immediately)

*** Reversed Lebensohl RLEB

- Only when we can PASS and partner is expected to be UNBALANCED, i.e (1M)--X--(2M), but could be (2D multi)--X--(2M) or
  (1m)--2m
- In these auctions where partner is unbalanced and often has their own suit to show then transfer Lebensohl makes less sense
- Unlike Better Minor "Gucci" Lebensohl, we can just pass if we have nothing helpful to say
- The auction is already live with two bids from the opposition, we need to show shape or NT feature immediately
- 2N puts focus on finding a NT contract, promises some sort of stop(s) and is at least invitational. This 2N is
  "Reversed" compared to standard Lebensohl in that it does not focus on splitting up strength ranges weak/invite/GF. It
  focuses on do we have a *stop* and game try values. This is reasonable because we can always pass with a bad hand and
  with a very weak hand opposite a very strong partner we maybe pushed towards game anyway - we often don't have enough
  space to discourage them if they are doing power takeout doubles
- 3x new suits are weak / competitive with no way to show invitational strength, i.e ~0--9(10) hcp. You must choose
  between a game punt or competing (which is similar to the Better Minor Gucci Lebensohl 3!c bid). The motivation is to
  get into the auction before opener shuts us out. We might compete and reopen double with a max 9/10 hcp
- Double is the usual [responsive double style](#Responsive Doubles Style) which can include flattish / no stop hands
  including a 5 card !h invite after (1S)--X--(2S)
- the name doesn't really help, as other variations of Lebensohl might be called "Reverse" Lebensohl (without the 'd')

Having said all the above, there is more invitational nuance when the opponents bid the lower suits, !cs, !ds and !hs.
It might be better to play these jump 3x bids as GF with possible slam interest instead of invitational, but that would
be rarer. A GF 5+ card hand with stop can bid 2N first, and without a stop start with a cue bid and hope to resolve e.g.
both majors vs one major slam try later

* Overcalls of our NT

- 1NT opening then interference
- 1NT overcall then interference
- 1!c/1!d openings which are assumed to be NT type hands

*** What is our *first double*?

The *default is negative*, meaning any of:

- weak competitive hand with perfect takeout shape, 4--4--4--1
- less than invitational, but can handle partner's responses with minimum level conversion bids. Note, because opener is
  very defined they never jump the bidding and minimum level conversion fits unlike other negative double scenarios
- invitational plus hands, possibly very off shape, just trying to showing e.g. a 4 card other major
- even *balancing by opener*, most hands with doubleton in their suit, 15+ hcp outside of the doubleton

Any negative double at the 3 level (especially 4 level!) is basically GF and starts to lack clear shape information,
mostly being used to show values.

Priority order meta agreement (that works in other situations such as us opening 1HS and opponents bidding 2 suiters)
for 2 and 3 level interference:

1. two specific suits, e.g. 2C/2D majors, 2N minors -- values, system off even over 2C
2. over double or 2!c interference -- system on, stolen bid double
3. artificial, may show some other suit, e.g. transfer overcall, (X) major + minor, or 2C !h + any, or 2C any single suiter, or 2D multi -- biddable natural suit
3. natural catchall, e.g. 2D !d + any, 2H !h + any -- negative

- values means we want to take ownership of the auction. At that point partner will double for penalty or pass
  and let us double for penalty, otherwise we bid on having shown invitational plus values with the inability to penalise
- after a natural (values in suit / stolen) double of an ambiguous bid, e.g. 2!c showing some single suiter and double
  showing !cs, our side can double again as if they were making their first bid (presumably something more natural)
- we focus on penalty / value doubles of artificial specific two suiters as they are less like to have a "safe" 6 card
  suit to play in compared to single suiter overcalls and it's easy to be specific about cue bids

*** What is a redouble?

A *redouble* of a non-penalty double has the same meanings as double. The exception is a redouble of an artificial bid
cannot show a biddable suit so it is again *values* showing.

When the opposing double is penalty/values we naturally use the [1NT Escape](#1NT Escape) module.

*** What is our *second double*?

- Normally, double is *penalty*
- After doubling an artificial bid initially, double follows the same rules as our *first double*

*** negative double responses

Natural mainly but

- 2N scrambling over (2!h/2!s)--X, e.g. 4--4, or 4--3 minors and 3 card bad major
- 2N natural over (2!c/2!d)--X

*** what is a generic cue bid?

Where the cue bid does not have a specific meaning (such as *directly* over 2C showing majors):

- When we have TWO KNOWN suits to stop, then cue bids SHOW a stop
- With ONE KNOWN suit to stop, then cue bids ASK for a stop
- With negative doubles there's less need for staymanic cue bids, but a higher cue can be GF staymanic with singleton

* 1NT Escape

Situations include:

- (1x)--1N--(X)
- (1N)--X--(P)
- (1N)--X--(XX)
- 1N--(X), rarely used though

- When we overcall 1N, rarely a *redouble by opener* is a hand interested in running - *minimum* with a *5(6) card suit* for the NT bid

*** when opponents run after we have showed values

This is when we pass or XX with values and our side is done with the first round of bidding, meaning our side is
happy to sit in 1N double or redoubled - no need to escape and no GF offensive hand.

- The *1st double* is takeout, not with a void, so 1--2 cards
- The *2nd+ double* is penalty
- Sitting over penalty is 4+ cards
- Sitting under penalty is cooperative 3+ cards
- Cue (now delayed) is a general force
- 2N (now delayed) by the weaker hand is natural
- new suit (now delayed) is forcing


*** when opponents run immediately and (semi)naturally to 2DHS

With (1N)--X--(run), or rarely (1N)--P--(P)--X--(run) our combined strength is less defined. Length is promised in the
suit bid.

This is a *Lebensohl* situation.

- The *1st double* is takeout
- The *2nd+ double* is penalty
- unclear, forcing pass up to 2!h
- 2x competitive
- 2N+ Lebensohl system, with the penalty doubler possibly breaking the relay with hand too good to overcall

*** when opponents run immediately artificially to 2CDH

For example, 2C scurry with no 5 card major.

- The *1st double* is *values*, then forcing pass up to 2!h, then resets to the "when the bid naturally" rules
- Then *Resets* to *next double takeout* then *double penalty* (by either partner)
- Pass is implied weak, not forcing, but could have later values to show

*** when opponents run immediately with transfer escape

- The *1st double* is *values*, then forcing pass up to 2!h, then resets to the "when the bid naturally" rules
- Then *Resets* to *next double takeout* then *double penalty* (by either partner)
- Standard double rules apply
- A *Pass then double of transfer by advancer is 4+ card penalty*


*** when opponents run immediately to 2S or higher

- double *values*
- 2N+ Lebensohl system, if available, with the penalty doubler possibly breaking the relay with hand too good to
  overcall
- 3x new suit natural, forcing
